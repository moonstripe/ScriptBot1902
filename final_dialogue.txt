      BIANCA  They do not!
      CAMERON  They do to!
      BIANCA  I hope so.
      CAMERON  She okay?
      BIANCA  Let's go.
      CAMERON  Wow
      BIANCA  Okay -- you're gonna need to learn how to lie.
      CAMERON  No
      BIANCA  I'm kidding.  You know how sometimes you just become this "persona"?  And you don't know how to quit?
      BIANCA  Like my fear of wearing pastels?
      CAMERON  The "real you".
      BIANCA  What good stuff?
      CAMERON  I figured you'd get to the good stuff eventually.
      CAMERON  Thank God!  If I had to hear one more story about your coiffure...
      BIANCA  Me.  This endless ...blonde babble. I'm like, boring myself.
      CAMERON  What crap?
      BIANCA  do you listen to this crap?
      CAMERON  No...
      BIANCA  Then Guillermo says, "If you go any lighter, you're gonna look like an extra on ."
      CAMERON  You always been this selfish?
      BIANCA  But
      CAMERON  Then that's all you had to say.
      BIANCA  Well, no...
      CAMERON  You never wanted to go out with 'me, did you?
      BIANCA  I was?
      CAMERON  I looked for you back at the party, but you always seemed to be "occupied".
      BIANCA  Tons
      CAMERON  Have fun tonight?
      CAMERON  I believe we share an art instructor
      BIANCA  You know Chastity?
      CAMERON  Looks like things worked out tonight, huh?
      BIANCA  Hi.
      BIANCA  Who knows?  All I've ever heard her say is that she'd dip before dating a guy that smokes.
      CAMERON  So that's the kind of guy she likes? Pretty ones?
      BIANCA  Lesbian?  No. I found a picture of Jared Leto in one of her drawers, so I'm pretty sure she's not harboring same-sex tendencies.
      CAMERON  She's not a...
      CAMERON  I'm workin' on it. But she doesn't seem to be goin' for him.
      BIANCA  I really, really, really wanna go, but I can't.  Not unless my sister goes.
      CAMERON  Sure have.
      BIANCA  Eber's Deep Conditioner every two days. And I never, ever use a blowdryer without the diffuser attachment.
      CAMERON  How do you get your hair to look like that?
      BIANCA  You're sweet.
      CAMERON  You have my word.  As a gentleman
      BIANCA  I counted on you to help my cause. You and that thug are obviously failing. Aren't we ever going on our date?
      CAMERON  You got something on your mind?
      BIANCA  Where?
      CAMERON  There.
      CAMERON  Well, there's someone I think might be --
      BIANCA  How is our little Find the Wench A Date plan progressing?
      BIANCA  Forget French.
      CAMERON  That's because it's such a nice one.
      BIANCA  I don't want to know how to say that though.  I want to know useful things. Like where the good stores are.  How much does champagne cost?  Stuff like Chat.  I have never in my life had to point out my head to someone.
      CAMERON  Right.  See?  You're ready for the quiz.
      BIANCA  C'esc ma tete. This is my head
      CAMERON  Let me see what I can do.
      BIANCA  Gosh, if only we could find Kat a boyfriend...
      CAMERON  That's a shame.
      BIANCA  Unsolved mystery.  She used to be really popular when she started high school, then it was just like she got sick of it or something.
      CAMERON  Why?
      CAMERON  Seems like she could get a date easy enough...
      BIANCA  The thing is, Cameron -- I'm at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser.  My sister.  I can't date until she does.
      CAMERON  Cameron.
      BIANCA  No, no, it's my fault -- we didn't have a proper introduction ---
      CAMERON  Forget it.
      BIANCA  You're asking me out.  That's so cute. What's your name again?
      CAMERON  Okay... then how 'bout we try out some French cuisine.  Saturday?  Night?
      BIANCA  Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part.  Please.
      CAMERON  Well, I thought we'd start with pronunciation, if that's okay with you.
      BIANCA  Can we make this quick?  Roxanne Korrine and Andrew Barrett are having an incredibly horrendous public break- up on the quad.  Again.
      BIANCA  I did.
      CHASTITY  You think you ' re the only sophomore at the prom?
      CHASTITY  I don't have to be home 'til two.
      BIANCA  I have to be home in twenty minutes.
      CHASTITY  All I know is -- I'd give up my private line to go out with a guy like Joey.
      BIANCA  Sometimes I wonder if the guys we're supposed to want to go out with are the ones we actually want to go out with, you know?
      CHASTITY  Bianca, I don't think the highlights of dating Joey Dorsey are going to include door-opening and coat-holding.
      BIANCA  Combination.  I don't know -- I thought he'd be different.  More of a gentleman...
      CHASTITY  Is he oily or dry?
      BIANCA  He practically proposed when he found out we had the same dermatologist. I mean. Dr. Bonchowski is great an all, but he's not exactly relevant party conversation.
      BIANCA  Would you mind getting me a drink, Cameron?
      CHASTITY  Great
      BIANCA  Joey.
      CHASTITY  Who?
      BIANCA  Where did he go?  He was just here.
      BIANCA  You might wanna think about it
      CHASTITY  No.
      BIANCA  Did you change your hair?
      BIANCA  You know the deal.  I can ' t go if Kat doesn't go --
      JOEY  Listen, I want to talk to you about the prom.
      JOEY  You're concentrating awfully hard considering it's gym class.
      BIANCA  Hi, Joey.
      JOEY  Hey, sweet cheeks.
      JOEY  My agent says I've got a good shot at being the Prada guy next year.
      BIANCA  Neat...
      JOEY  It's a gay cruise line, but I'll be, like, wearing a uniform and stuff.
      BIANCA  Queen Harry?
      JOEY  So yeah, I've got the Sears catalog thing going -- and the tube sock gig " that's gonna be huge.  And then I'm up for an ad for Queen Harry next week.
      BIANCA  Hopefully.
      JOEY  Exactly  So, you going to Bogey Lowenbrau's thing on Saturday?
      BIANCA  Expensive?
      JOEY  It's more
      KAT  Perm?
      BIANCA  Patrick -- is that- a.
      KAT  It's just you.
      BIANCA  Is that woman a complete fruit-loop or is it just me?
      BIANCA  No! I just wanted
      KAT  What? To completely damage me?  To send me to therapy forever? What?
      BIANCA  I just wanted --
      KAT  You set me up.
      BIANCA  Let go!
      KAT  So did you
      BIANCA  You looked beautiful last night, you know.
      BIANCA  I guess I'll never know, will I?
      KAT  Not all experiences are good, Bianca. You can't always trust the people you want to.
      BIANCA  God, you're just like him! Just keep me locked away in the dark, so I can't experience anything for myself
      KAT  I guess I thought I was protecting you.
      BIANCA  I'm not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes.
      KAT  That's not
      BIANCA  No. you didn't!  If you really thought I could make my own decisions, you would've let me go out with him instead of helping Daddy hold me hostage.
      KAT  I wanted to let you make up your own mind about him.
      BIANCA  Why didn't you tell me?
      KAT  After that, I swore I'd never do anything just because "everyone else" was doing it.  And I haven't since. Except for Bogey's party, and my stunning gastro-intestinal display --
      BIANCA  But
      KAT  Just once.  Afterwards, I told him I didn't want to anymore.  I wasn't ready. He got pissed.  Then he broke up with me.
      BIANCA  You did what?
      KAT  He said everyone was doing it.  So I did it.
      BIANCA  As in...
      KAT  Now I do.  Back then, was a different story.
      BIANCA  But you hate Joey
      KAT  He was, like, a total babe
      BIANCA  Why?
      KAT  In 9th.  For a month
      BIANCA  What?
      KAT  Joey never told you we went out, did he?
      BIANCA  I wish I had that luxury. I'm the only sophomore that got asked to the prom and I can't go, because you won ' t.
      KAT  I do care. But I'm a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons, not someone else ' s .
      BIANCA  Like you care.
      KAT  Listen, I know you hate having to sit home because I'm not Susie High School.
      KAT  You're welcome.
      BIANCA  I don't get you.  You act like you're too good for any of this, and then you go totally apeshit when you get here.
      BIANCA  I really don't think I need any social advice from you right now.
      KAT  Bianca, I need to talk to you -- I need to tell you --
      KAT  Can we go now?
      BIANCA  You are so completely unbalanced.
      BIANCA  Yeah, he's your freak friend Mandella's boyfriend.  I guess since I'm not allowed to go out, I should obsess over a dead guy, too.
      KAT  It's Shakespeare.  Maybe you've heard of him?
      BIANCA  Like I'm supposed to know what that even means.
      KAT  At least I'm not a clouted fen- sucked hedge-pig.
      BIANCA  Can't you forget for just one night that you're completely wretched?
      BIANCA  Bogey Lowenstein's party is normal, but you're too busy listening to Bitches Who Need Prozac to know that.
      KAT  What's normal?
      BIANCA  You're ruining my life'  Because you won't be normal, I can't be normal.
      BIANCA  I think you're a freak.  I think you do this to torture me.  And I think you suck.
      KAT  What do you think?
      BIANCA  Oh, I thought you might have a date  I don't know why I'm bothering to ask, but are you going to Bogey Lowenstein's party Saturday night?
      KAT  It means that Gigglepuss is playing at Club Skunk and we're going.
      BIANCA  Oh my God, does this mean you're becoming normal?
      BIANCA  Can you at least start wearing a bra?
      KAT  I have the potential to smack the crap out of you if you don't get out of my way.
      BIANCA  Nowhere... Hi, Daddy.
      KAT  Where've you been?
      BIANCA  I have a date, Daddy.  And he ' s not a captain of oppression like some men we know.
      WALTER  I'm missing something.
      BIANCA  Fine.  I see that I'm a prisoner in my own house.  I'm not a daughter. I'm a possession!
      WALTER  You're not going unless your sister goes.  End of story.
      BIANCA  He's not a "hot rod".  Whatever that is.
      WALTER  It's that hot rod Joey, right? That ' s who you want me to bend my rules for?
      BIANCA  No, but
      WALTER  The prom?  Kat has a date?
      BIANCA  Daddy, I want to discuss the prom with you. It's tomorrow night --
      WALTER  Because she'll scare them away.
      BIANCA  Why?
      WALTER  Promise me you won't talk to any boys unless your sister is present.
      WALTER  Just for a minute
      BIANCA  Daddy, no!
      WALTER  Wear the belly before you go.
      BIANCA  It's just a party. Daddy.
      WALTER  Oh, God.  It's starting.
      WALTER  If Kat's not going, you're not going.
      BIANCA  Daddy, people expect me to be there!
      BIANCA  It's just a party. Daddy, but I knew you'd forbid me to go since "Gloria Steinem" over there isn't going --
      WALTER  Otherwise known as an orgy?
9      BIANCA  If you must know, we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends.
8      WALTER  And where're you going?
7      BIANCA  Daddy, I --
      WALTER  Exactly my point
      BIANCA  But she doesn't want to date.
      BIANCA  But it's not fair -- she's a mutant, Daddy!
      WALTER  Then neither will you.  And I'll get to sleep at night.
      BIANCA  What if she never starts dating?
      WALTER  No! You're not dating until your sister starts dating.  End of discussion.
      BIANCA  Now don't get upset. Daddy, but there's this boy... and I think he might ask...
      BRUCE  Just sent 'em through.
      PATRICK  Padua girls.  One tall, decent body. The other one kinda short and undersexed?
      BRUCE  Never
      PATRICK  Fan of a fan.  You see a couple of minors come in?
      BRUCE  Didn't have you pegged for a Gigglepuss fan.  Aren't they a little too pre-teen belly-button ring for you?
      PATRICK  Always a pleasure, Brucie.
      MICHAEL  Best case scenario, you're back on the payroll for awhile.
      CAMERON  You humiliated the woman! Sacrifice yourself on the altar of dignity and even the score.
      CAMERON  No, I ' m not.
      MICHAEL  Buttholus extremus.  But hey, you're making progress.
      CAMERON  The hell is that?  What kind of 'guy just picks up a girl and carries her away while you're talking to her?
      MICHAEL  Extremely unfortunate maneuver.
0      CAMERON  Hell, I've just been going over the whole thing in my head and -
9      MICHAEL  You told me that part already.
      CAMERON  It's her favorite band.
      MICHAEL  Assail your ears for one night.
      CAMERON  Okay!  I wasn't sure
      MICHAEL  He's pretty!
      MICHAEL  Dead at forty-one.
      CAMERON  Her favorite uncle
      MICHAEL  It's a lung cancer issue
      CAMERON  Number one.  She hates smokers
      MICHAEL  Are you kidding?  He'll piss himself with joy.  He's the ultimate kiss ass.
      CAMERON  Will Bogey get bent?
      MICHAEL  In that case, we'll need to make it a school-wide blow out.
      CAMERON  This is it.  A golden opportunity. Patrick can ask Katarina to the party.
      MICHAEL  Like we had a choice?  Besides -- when you let the enemy think he's orchestrating the battle, you're in a position of power. We let him pretend he's calling the shots, and while he's busy setting up the plan, you have time to woo Bianca.
      CAMERON  You got him involved?
      MICHAEL  Hey -- I've gotta have a few clients when I get to Wall Street.
      CAMERON  I thought you hated those people.
      MICHAEL  You know, if you do go out with Bianca, you'd be set.  You'd outrank everyone. Strictly A-list.  With me by your side.
      CAMERON  That's what I just said
      MICHAEL  Did she actually say she'd go out with you?
      CAMERON  Forget his reputation.  Do you think we've got a plan or not?
      MICHAEL  I'm serious, man, he's whacked.  He sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers.
      CAMERON  They always let felons sit in on Honors Biology?
      MICHAEL  No kidding.  He's a criminal.  I heard he lit a state trooper on fire.  He just got out of Alcatraz...
      CAMERON  He seems like he thrives on danger
      MICHAEL  What makes you think he'll do it?
      MICHAEL  You wanna go out with him?
      CAMERON  What about him?
      MICHAEL  Unlikely, but even so, she still can't go out with you.  So what's the point?
      CAMERON  I teach her French, get to know her, dazzle her with charm and she falls in love with me.
      MICHAEL  The mewling, rampalian wretch herself.
      CAMERON  That's her?  Bianca's sister?
      MICHAEL  Yeah, just a minor encounter with the shrew.
      MICHAEL  You could consecrate with her, my friend.
      CAMERON  You mean I'd get a chance to talk to her?
      MICHAEL  Guess who just signed up for a tutor?
      CAMERON  Sure do ... my Mom's from Canada
      MICHAEL  You know French?
      MICHAEL  Joey Dorsey?  Perma-shit-grin.  I wish I could say he's a moron, but he's number twelve in the class.  And a model.  Mostly regional stuff, but he's rumored to have a big tube sock ad coming out.
      CAMERON  He always have that shit-eating grin?
      MICHAEL  Because they're bred to.  Their mothers liked guys like that, and their grandmothers before them. Their gene pool is rarely diluted.
      CAMERON  Why do girls like that always like guys like that?
      MICHAEL  I could start with your haircut, but it doesn't matter.  She's not allowed to date until her older sister does.  And that's an impossibility.
      CAMERON  Why not?
      MICHAEL  Bianca Stratford.  Sophomore. Don't even think about it
      CAMERON  Who is she?
      MICHAEL  You burn, you pine, you perish?
      CAMERON  That girl -- I --
      MICHAEL  Yeah, but these guys have never seen a horse.  They just jack off to Clint Eastwood.
      CAMERON  That I'm used to.
      MICHAEL  Couple thousand. Most of them evil
      CAMERON  How many people go here?
      MICHAEL  Get out!
      CAMERON  Thirty-two.
      MICHAEL  How many people were in your old school?
      CAMERON  Yeah.  A couple.  We're outnumbered by the cows, though.
      MICHAEL  I was kidding. People actually live there?
      CAMERON  North, actually.  How'd you   ?
      MICHAEL  So -- which Dakota you from?
      MICHAEL  C'mon.  I'm supposed to give you the tour.
      CAMERON  So they tell me...
      MICHAEL  You the new guy?
1      CAMERON  You get the girl.
0      PATRICK  What's the worst?
5      PATRICK  Where?
4      CAMERON  She kissed me.
3      PATRICK  You makin' any headway?
1      PATRICK  She just needs time to cool off I'll give it a day.
0      CAMERON  She hates you with the fire of a thousand suns .  That's a direct quote
6      PATRICK  I don ' t know.  I decided not to nail her when she was too drunk to remember it.
5      CAMERON  What'd you do to her?
      PATRICK  Then, go get her
      CAMERON  Sure
      PATRICK  Cameron -- do you like the girl?
      CAMERON  She's partial to Joey, not me
      PATRICK  What 're you talking about?
      CAMERON  It's off. The whole thing.
      PATRICK  Cameron, I'm a little busy
      PATRICK  Don't make me do it, man
      CAMERON  Gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow night.
      PATRICK  So what does that give me?  I'm supposed to buy her some noodles and a book and sit around listening to chicks who can't play their instruments?
      CAMERON  Okay -- Likes:  Thai food, feminist prose, and "angry, stinky girl music of the indie-rock persuasion".
      CAMERON  I've retrieved certain pieces of information on Miss Katarina Stratford I think you'll find helpful.
      PATRICK  What've you got for me?
      PATRICK  Yeah -- we'll see.
      CAMERON  And he means that strictly in a non- prison-movie type of way.
      JOEY  And why would I do that?
      KAT  Leave my sister alone.
      JOEY  Your sister here?
      KAT  Away.
      JOEY  Where ya goin?
      JOEY  Not at all
      KAT  Hey -- do you mind?
      JOEY  They're running the rest of me next month.
      KAT  Yeah, and I noticed the only part of you featured in your big Kmart spread was your elbow.  Tough break.
      JOEY  The vintage look is over, Kat. Haven't you been reading your Sassy?
8      JOEY  Enough with the Barbie n' Ken shit. I know.
7      PATRICK  I don't know, Dorsey. ..the limo.-the flowers.  Another hundred for the tux --
      JOEY  Get her to act like a human
      PATRICK  Do what?
      JOEY  How'd you do it?
      JOEY  A deal's a deal.
      PATRICK  It's about time.
      PATRICK  Forget her sister, then.
      JOEY  Forget it.
      PATRICK  A hundred bucks a date.
      JOEY  What?
      PATRICK  I just upped my price
      PATRICK  I got her under control. She just acts crazed in public to keep up the image.
      JOEY  Watching the bitch trash my car doesn't count as a date.
      PATRICK  I'm on it
      JOEY  When I shell out fifty, I expect results.
      PATRICK  Fifty, and you've got your man.
      JOEY  Take it or leave it.  This isn't a negotiation.
      JOEY  Fine, thirty.
      PATRICK  I can't take a girl like that out on twenty bucks.
      PATRICK  How much?
      JOEY  I can't date her sister until that one gets a boyfriend.  And that's the catch. She doesn't want a boyfriend.
      PATRICK  You're gonna pay me to take out some girl?
      JOEY  You got it, Verona.  I pick up the tab, you do the honors.
      JOEY  But you'd go out with her if you had the cake?
      PATRICK  You need money to take a girl out
      JOEY  You just said
      PATRICK  Sure, Sparky.  I'll get right on it.
      JOEY  Yeah, whatever.  I want you to go out with her.
      PATRICK  Two legs, nice rack...
      JOEY  What do you think?
      PATRICK  Yeah
9      MICHAEL  Hey -- it's all for the higher good right?
8      JOEY  You better not fuck this up.  I'm heavily invested.
5      MICHAEL  What?  We took bathes together when we were kids.
4      JOEY  You and Verona?
3      MICHAEL  Uh,  yeah.  We're old friend*
2      JOEY  I hear you're helpin' Verona.
      MICHAEL  So what you need to do is recruit a guy who'll go out with her.  Someone who's up for the job.
      JOEY  Does this conversation have a purpose?
      MICHAEL  But she can't go out with you because her sister is this insane head case and no one will go out with her. right?
      JOEY  We're not.
      MICHAEL  Well, actually, I thought I'd run an idea by you.  You know, just to see if you're interested.
      JOEY  We don't chat.
      MICHAEL  Nope - just came by to chat
      JOEY  Are you lost?
      MICHAEL  Hey.
      KAT  Oh, honey -- tell me we haven't' progressed to full-on hallucinations.
      MANDELLA  William - he asked me to meet him here.
      KAT  Who?
      MANDELLA  Have you seen him?
      MANDELLA  Oh, good.  Something new and different for us.
      KAT  You ' re looking at this from the wrong perspective.  We're making a statement.
      MANDELLA  Okay, okay, we won't go.  It's not like I have a dress anyway
      KAT  Listen to you!  You sound like Betty, all pissed off because Archie is taking Veronica.
      MANDELLA  Well, I guess we're not, since we don't have dates .
      KAT  Can you even imagine?  Who the hell would go to this a bastion of commercial excess?
1      KAT  I got drunk.  I puked.  I got rejected. It was big fun.
0      MANDELLA  You didn't
9      KAT  I did Bianca a favor and it backfired.
8      MANDELLA  You didn't have a choice?  Where's Kat and what have you done with her?
7      KAT  I didn't have a choice.
6      MANDELLA  You went to the party?  I thought we were officially opposed to suburban social activity.
1      KAT  Who cares?
0      MANDELLA  What'd he say?
      KAT  No fear.
      MANDELLA  You think this'll work?
      KAT  If I was Bianca, it would be, "Any school you want, precious.  Don't forget your tiara."
      MANDELLA  Does it matter?
      KAT  I appreciate your efforts toward a speedy death, but I'm consuming.  Do you mind?
      KAT  Neither has his heterosexuality.
      MANDELLA  That's never been proven
      KAT  William didn't even go to high school
      MANDELLA  William would never have gone to a state school.
      KAT  So he has this huge raging fit about Sarah Lawrence and insists that I go to his male-dominated, puking frat boy, number one golf team school. I have no say at all.
      MANDELLA  You could always go with me.  I'm sure William has some friends.
      KAT  The people at this school are so incredibly foul.
      MANDELLA  But imagine the things he'd say during sex.
      KAT  I realize that the men of this fine institution are severely lacking, but killing yourself so you can be with William Shakespeare is beyond the scope of normal teenage obsessions.  You're venturing far past daytime talk show fodder and entering the world of those who need very expensive therapy.
      MANDELLA  An attempted slit.
      KAT  What's this?
      MANDELLA  Just a little.
      KAT  Mandella, eat.  Starving yourself is a very slow way to die.
      KAT  Block E?
      MANDELLA  He always look so
      KAT  I'm sure he's completely incapable of doing anything that interesting.
      MANDELLA  That's Pat Verona? The one who was gone for a year? I heard he was doing porn movies.
      KAT  Patrick Verona   Random skid.
      MANDELLA  Who's that?
      PATRICK  Don ' t you even dare. . .
      KAT  Oh, Bianca?  Can you get me my freshman yearbook?
      PATRICK  Because I like to torture you.
      KAT  Why is my veggie burger the only burnt object on this grill?
      PATRICK  Yeah, but then I fucked up. I fell for her.
      KAT  Is that right?
      PATRICK  Besides, I had some extra cash. Some asshole paid me to take out a really great girl.
      PATRICK  I thought you could use it. When you start your band.
      KAT  A Fender Strat. You bought this?
      PATRICK  I didn't care about the money.
      KAT  Really?  What was it like?  A down payment now, then a bonus for sleeping with me?
      PATRICK  It wasn't like that.
      KAT  You were paid to take me out!  By -- the one person I truly hate.  I knew it was a set-up!
      PATRICK  Wait I...
      PATRICK  It gets worse -- you still have your freshman yearbook?
      KAT  That ' s completely adorable!
      PATRICK  That's where I was last year.  She'd never lived alone -- my grandfather died -- I stayed with her.  I wasn't in jail, I don't know Marilyn Manson, and I've never slept with a Spice Girl.  I spent a year sitting next to my grandma on the couch watching Wheel of Fortune.  End of story.
      KAT  What?
      PATRICK  My grandmother's .
      KAT  Look, I'm  -- sorry -- that I questioned your motives.  I was wrong.
      PATRICK  Oh huh
      KAT  It's just something I had.  You know
      PATRICK  It's Scurvy's.  His date got convicted. Where'd you get the dress?
      KAT  How'd you get a tux at the last minute?
      PATRICK  Nothing!  There's nothing in it for me. Just the pleasure of your company.
      KAT  Answer the question, Patrick
      PATRICK  You need therapy.  Has anyone ever told you that?
      KAT  You tell me.
      PATRICK  So I have to have a motive to be with you?
      KAT  Create a little drama?  Start a new rumor?  What?
      KAT  Because I don't want to. It's a stupid tradition.
      PATRICK  Why not?
      KAT  No, I won't go with you
      PATRICK  No what?
      KAT  No.
      PATRICK  You know what I mean
      KAT  Is that a request or a command?
      PATRICK  Go to the prom with me
      KAT  You're amazingly self-assured. Has anyone ever told you that?
      PATRICK  No one else knows
      KAT  What?
      PATRICK  You're sweet.  And sexy.  And completely hot for me.
      KAT  No -- something real.  Something no one else knows.
      PATRICK  I hate peas.
      KAT  Tell me something true.
      KAT  I know the porn career's a lie.
      PATRICK  Hearsay.
      KAT  The duck?
      PATRICK  Fallacy.
      KAT  State trooper?
      KAT  For. . . ?
      PATRICK  You up for it?
      PATRICK  You never disappointed me.
      KAT  How?
      PATRICK  Then you screwed up
      KAT  Something like that
      PATRICK  So if you disappoint them from the start, you're covered?
      KAT  I don't like to do what people expect. Then they expect it all the time and they get disappointed when you change.
      PATRICK  Yes
      KAT  Acting the way we do.
      PATRICK  So what's your excuse?
      KAT  Yeah, well, don't let it get out
      PATRICK  A soft side? Who knew?
      KAT  I dazzled him with my wit
      PATRICK  So how'd you get Chapin to look the other way?
      KAT  Good call.
      PATRICK  I figured it had to be something ridiculous to win your respect.  And piss you off.
      KAT  The Partridge Family?
      PATRICK  Maybe.
      KAT  You want me to climb up and show you how to get down?
      PATRICK  Forget it.  I'm stayin'.
      KAT  Put your right foot there --
      PATRICK  Try lookin' at it from this angle
      KAT  C'mon.  It's not that bad
      PATRICK  I guess I never told you I'm afraid of heights.
      PATRICK  Look up, sunshine
      KAT  He left!  I sprung the dickhead and he cruised on me.
4      KAT  Other than my upchuck reflex? Nothing.
3      PATRICK  So what did I have an effect on ?
2      KAT  Don't for one minute think that you had any effect whatsoever on my panties.
1      PATRICK  Unwelcome?  I guess someone still has her panties in a twist.
0      KAT  Unwelcome.
      PATRICK  Wholesome.
      PATRICK  Pleasant?
      KAT  You 're so --
      PATRICK  I heard there was a poetry reading.
      KAT  What are you doing here?
      PATRICK  Excuse me, have you seen The Feminine Mystique?  I lost my copy.
0      PATRICK  No offense, but you're sister is without.  I know everyone likes her and all, but ...
9      KAT  BIANCA
8      PATRICK  Who?
7      KAT  He just wants me to be someone I'm not.
6      PATRICK  So what ' s up with your dad?  He a pain in the ass?
4      PATRICK  I'm gettin' there
3      KAT  Oh, so now you think you know me?
2      PATRICK  You don't strike me as the type that would ask permission.
1      KAT  My father wouldn't approve of that that
0      PATRICK  Start a band?
9      KAT  This.
8      PATRICK  Do what?
7      KAT  I should do this.
6      KAT  Why'd you lie?
5      PATRICK  Then why'd you ask?
4      KAT  No, you weren't
3      PATRICK  Maybe.
2      KAT  Were you in jail?
1      PATRICK  Busy
0      KAT  When you were gone last year -- where were you?
9      KAT  But it's Gigglepuss - I know you like them.  I saw you there.
8      PATRICK  And I'm in control of it.
1      KAT  What?
0      PATRICK  Kat! Wake up!
6      KAT  You know what they say
5      PATRICK  I thought you were above all that
4      KAT  Hey man. . .  You don ' t think I can be "cool"?  You don't think I can be "laid back" like everyone else?
3      PATRICK  I know.  It'd have to be a pretty big deal to get you to mainline tequila. You don't seem like the type.
2      KAT  I hate him.
1      PATRICK  Dorsey.
0      KAT  Who?
9      PATRICK  Why'd you let him get to you?
6      KAT  Just let me sit down.
5      PATRICK  See that?  Who needs affection when I've got blind hatred?
4      KAT  Like you could find one
3      PATRICK  Because then I'd have to start taking out girls who like me.
2      KAT  Why?
1      PATRICK  Sure, I do
0      KAT  You don't care if I die
      PATRICK  I told you
      KAT  Why 're you doing this?
      PATRICK  Leave it to you to use big words when you're shitfaced.
      KAT  This is so patronizing.
      PATRICK  What if you have a concussion? My dog went to sleep with a concussion and woke up a vegetable. Not that I could tell the difference...
      KAT  I know, just let me sleep
      PATRICK  Uh, uh. You lie down and you'll go to sleep
      KAT  I just need to lie down for awhile
      PATRICK  You're not okay.
      KAT  I'm fine. I'm
      PATRICK  Okay?
      KAT  Funny, you're the only one
      PATRICK  I say, do what you wanna do.
      KAT  "I'm getting trashed, man." Isn't that what you're supposed to do at a party?
      PATRICK  What's this?
      PATRICK  Why, don't you?
      KAT  You know who The Raincoats are?
      PATRICK  You know, these guys are no Bikini Kill or The Raincoats, but they're right up there.
      PATRICK  Do you mind?  You're sort of ruining it for me.
      KAT  That's what you want, isn't it?
      PATRICK  Excuse me?
      KAT  
      PATRICK  hey.  Great show, huh?
      KAT  Depends on the topic. My fenders don't really whip me into a verbal frenzy.
      PATRICK  You're not a big talker, are you?
      KAT  Hi
      PATRICK  I was in the laundromat. I saw your car. Thought I'd say hi.
      KAT  Are you following me?
      PATRICK  Seven-thirty?
      KAT  You -- covered in my vomit.
      PATRICK  Come on -- the ponies, the flat beer, you with money in your eyes, me with my hand on your ass...
      KAT  And why would I do that?
      PATRICK  Then say you'll spend Dollar Night at the track with me.
      KAT  I don't really think you warrant that strong an emotion.
      PATRICK  You hate me don't you?
      PATRICK  I know a lot more than that
      KAT  Like where?  The 7-Eleven on Burnside? Do you even know my name, screwboy?
      PATRICK  The night I take you to places you've never been before.  And back.
      KAT  Oh, right.  Friday.
      PATRICK  Pick you up Friday, then
      KAT  My mission in life.
      PATRICK  There's a way to get a guy's attention.
      KAT  Sweating like a pig, actually.  And yourself?
      PATRICK  I mean Wo-man.  How ya doin'?
      WALTER  Oh, Christ.  Don't tell me you've changed your mind.  I already sent 'em a check.
      KAT  When I go?
      WALTER  You know, fathers don't like to admit that their daughters are capable of running their own lives.  It means we've become spectators.  Bianca still lets me play a few innings.  You've had me on the bleachers for years.  When you go to Sarah Lawrence, I won't even be able to watch the game.
      WALTER  No -- impressed.
      KAT  What's the matter?  Upset that I rubbed off on her?
      WALTER  Bianca did what?
      KAT  The part where Bianca beat the hell out of some guy.
      WALTER  Which parts?
      KAT  Parts of it.
      WALTER  So tell me about this dance. Was it fun?
      KAT  No, Daddy.
      WALTER  I don't understand the allure of dehydrated food.  Is this something I should be hip to?
      WALTER  Funny.
      KAT  Yeah.  She left with some bikers Big ones.  Full of sperm.
      WALTER  Was that your sister?
      KAT  I want to go to an East Coast school! I want you to trust me to make my own choices.  I want --
      WALTER  You're eighteen.  You don't know what you want.  You won't know until you're forty-five and you don't have it.
      KAT  So what I want doesn't matter?
      WALTER  As a parent, that's my right
      KAT  Because you're making decisions for me.
      WALTER  Why can't we agree on this?
      KAT  I thought you were punishing me.
      WALTER  Is this about Sarah Lawrence? You punishing me?
      KAT  Then tell them I had a seizure.
      WALTER  My insurance does not cover PMS
      WALTER  Enough!
      KAT  This from someone whose diary is devoted to favorite grooming tips?
      KAT  You decided.
      WALTER  I thought we decided you were going to school here.  At U of 0.
      KAT  I know.
      MISS PERKY  Just smack her now.
      KAT  Am I supposed to feel better? Like, right now?  Or do I have some time to think about it?
      MISS PERKY  No ... I believe "heinous bitch" is the term used most often.
      KAT  Tempestuous?
      MISS PERKY  The point is Kat -- people perceive you as somewhat ...
      KAT  I still maintain that he kicked himself in the balls.  I was merely a spectator.
      MISS PERKY  Well, yes, compared to your other choices of expression this year, today's events are quite mild.  By the way, Bobby Rictor's gonad retrieval operation went quite well, in case you're interested.
      KAT  Expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action.
      MISS PERKY  Katarina Stratford.  My, my.  You've been terrorizing Ms. Blaise again.
8      MANDELLA  Yeah...
7      MICHAEL  Kat a fan, too?
6      MANDELLA  Right.
5      MICHAEL  Macbeth, right?
3      MICHAEL  Oh yeah.
2      MANDELLA  You think?
1      MANDELLA  Yeah.  I guess.
0      MICHAEL  Cool pictures.  You a fan?
9      MANDELLA  Hi.
8      MICHAEL  Hey there.  Tired of breathing?
7      PATRICK  Man -- don't say shit like that to  me. People can hear you.
6      MICHAEL  Sweet love, renew thy force!
5      PATRICK  You were right. She's still pissed.
4      PATRICK  No - I've got a sweet-payin' job that I'm about to lose.
3      MICHAEL  So you got cozy with she who stings?
      PATRICK  I'm likin' you guys better
      MICHAEL  I prefer to think of it simply as an alternative to what the law allows.
      PATRICK  Yeah.
      MICHAEL  Ever been to Club Skunk?
      MICHAEL  Just for now.
      PATRICK  Are you telling me I'm a -  "non-smoker"?
      MICHAEL  Good enough.
      PATRICK  What?!
      MICHAEL  We're your guys.
      PATRICK  You two are gonna help me tame the wild beast?
      MICHAEL  Patrick, Pat, you're not looking at the big picture.  Joey's just a pawn. We set this whole thing up so Cameron can get the girl.
      PATRICK  So Dorsey can get the girl?
      MICHAEL  That's where we can help you.  With Kat.
      PATRICK  Dorsey can plow whoever he wants. I'm just in this for the cash.
      MICHAEL  I think I speak correctly when I say that Cameron's love is pure.  Purer than say -- Joey Dorsey's.
      PATRICK  What is it with this chick?  She have three tits?
      MICHAEL  The situation is, my man Cameron here has a major jones for Bianca Stratford.
      PATRICK  What plan?
      PATRICK  Whatever the hell it is you're standin' there waitin' to say.
      MICHAEL  What?
      PATRICK  Say it
2      PATRICK  See you next week!
1      MISS PERKY  You're completely demented.
      PATRICK  Well, you know -- there's the prestige of the job title... and the benefits package is pretty good...
      MISS PERKY  You weren't abused, you aren't stupid, and as far as I can tell, you're only slightly psychotic -- so why is it that you're such a fuck-up?
      PATRICK  What's to discuss?
      MISS PERKY  Why don't we discuss your driving need to be a hemorrhoid?
      MISS PERKY  I'm at a loss, then.  What should we talk about? Your year of absence?
      PATRICK  Touch of the flu.
      MISS PERKY  I don't understand, Patrick.  You haven't done anything asinine this week. Are you not feeling well?
      MISS PERKY  With the teeth of your zipper?
      PATRICK  It was a bratwurst.  I was eating lunch.
      MISS PERKY  It says here you exposed yourself to a group of freshmen girls.
      PATRICK  I missed you.
      WALTER  That ' s what I thought
  0    SHARON  Absolutely not.
      WALTER  Did I have anything to say about it?
  0    SHARON  Your daughters went to the prom.
9      WALTER  What just happened?
7      WALTER  But -- who -- what --?
6  0    SHARON  Have a great time, honey!
8  0    SHARON  Dr. Ruth?
7      WALTER  What do you wanna watch?  We've got crap, crap, crap or crap
7      WALTER  Kissing?  Is that what you think happens?  Kissing isn't what keeps me up to my elbows in placenta all day.
6  0    SHARON  They'll dance, they'll kiss, they'll come home.  Let her go.
7      WALTER  Pirate -- no question.
6  0    SHARON  Would you rather be ravished by a pirate or a British rear admiral?
      WALTER  You're not helping.
  0    SHARON  Tumescent!
      WALTER  Jesus!  Can a man even grab a sandwich before you women start dilating?
      WALTER  Sarah Lawrence is on the other side of the country.
  0    SHARON  What's a synonym for throbbing?
      WALTER  Make anyone cry today?
  0    SHARON  In the microwave.
1  2    ALONSO  Can't be that far, I say.  Also, I don't like the smell of the sea around here.  Smells like a cunt. Bad sign...
0  3    SAILOR  We left three weeks ago, Alonso. Can't be that near.
9  2    ALONSO  We should have seen land.
7  3    SAILOR  We'll all go crazy...
6  2    ALONSO  He's the devil's child...
5  2    ALONSO  With a face like that?  I don't want you looking at me.  You hear?
4  3    SAILOR  Ah, leave him alone.  He's doing no harm.
3  2    ALONSO  What are you listening to, chicken ass?
2  2    ALONSO  You'll be drinking your own piss... For the glory of Spain... and Admiral Colon...!  Bastard!
1  3    SAILOR  The water's going putrid in the barrels.
0  2    ALONSO  I never seen heat like this!  Not even in Las Minas!
5  3    AROJAZ  IF-GOD-WILLS-IT!
4  6    COLUMBUS  Asia can be found to the west -- and I will prove it.
3  6    COLUMBUS  Blind faith is what I consider heresy!
2  3    AROJAZ  Don't you realize your words could be considered heretical?
0  6    COLUMBUS  Did He not choose a carpenter's son to reveal Himself to the world?
9  3    AROJAZ  If God intended our proximity to Asia, do you believe he would have waited for you to show it to the world?
6  6    COLUMBUS  No.  The Portuguese have already discovered black-skinned people.  I, too, will find other populations -- and bring them to the word of God.
5  3    AROJAZ  Is that all that interests you? Gold?
4  6    COLUMBUS  Trade, Your Excellency.  According to Marco Polo, the Kingdom of China is one of the richest of the world. Even the meanest buildings are roofed with gold.
2  6    COLUMBUS  If they agree to follow me, yes.
1  3    AROJAZ  Your life, and that of others!
0  6    COLUMBUS  Your Eminence, there is only one way to settle the matter.  And that is to make the journey.  I am ready to risk my life to prove it possible.
6  6    COLUMBUS  Excellency, you are right.
5  3    AROJAZ  Senor Colon, an experienced captain such as yourself will understand our concern with the crew.  I am not willing to have on my conscience the loss of men who would have relied upon our judgment.
3  3    AROJAZ  Then you cannot ignore that according to their calculations, the circumference of the Earth is approximately...  , leagues or more.  Which makes the ocean... uncrossable.
2  6    COLUMBUS  I am, Your Eminence
1  3    AROJAZ  Unfortunately, Don Colon, that is precisely where our opinions differ...  Are you familiar with the work of Aristotle?  Erathostene?  Ptolemeus?
0  6    COLUMBUS  Yes, your Eminence.  The voyage should not take more than six or seven weeks.
9  3    AROJAZ  You say Asia can be found by sailing west?
4  4    SANCHEZ  A waste...?  Let me tell you something, Arojaz.  If your name, or mine, is ever remembered -- it will only be because of his.
3  3    AROJAZ  What a tragedy... what a waste of a life...
2  4    SANCHEZ  You can see for yourself.
L  4    SANCHEZ  On the contrary, Your Eminence.  It seems to me the man is preparing his own cross.
L  3    AROJAZ  It won't be easy to get rid of your prophet now, Don Sanchez.
1  4    SANCHEZ  Indeed.  The world is full of mercenaries -- and states often make use of them, when it benefits them.  My only concern is the welfare and prosperity of Spain.
0  3    AROJAZ  He is a mercenary!  Did he not already try to convince the King of Portugal of his absurd notions?
9  4    SANCHEZ  Naturally.  But I would really deplore the loss of such a potential opportunity for Spain for a... dispute over a point of geography.
8  3    AROJAZ  The Judgment is ours!
7  4    SANCHEZ  The State has some reason to be interested in this man's proposition, Your Eminence...
0  6    COLUMBUS  I can't keep my eyes off you.  I would like to catch up with all the moments I didn't spend with you.
9  4    BEATRIX  What is it, now?  Tell me...
8  4    BEATRIX  I am busy inside.
7  6    COLUMBUS  Can't you stay with us a little?
4  6    COLUMBUS  Not everything... Do you think I care?  I'm a free man again.  Riches don't make a man rich, they only make him busier...
3  4    BEATRIX  They took everything...
2  4    BEATRIX  They tried... but I didn't let them.
1  6    COLUMBUS  God... you're so beautiful!  I can't believe no other man has ever taken you away from me...
0  6    COLUMBUS  I can arrange for the Queen to take Fernando and Diego into her service.
9  4    BEATRIX  You don't usually ask.
8  6    COLUMBUS  Beatrix, I want to ask you something.
3  4    BEATRIX  That's something you can't decide.
2  6    COLUMBUS  I don't want you to wait for me.
1  4    BEATRIX  I'm not asking you to swear to anything.
9  4    BEATRIX  Thank God...
8  6    COLUMBUS  She said yes.
6  4    BEATRIX  I find that hard to believe.
5  6    COLUMBUS  Perhaps I was never meant to live with a woman...
4  4    BEATRIX  I'd love to argue with you sometimes.  But you're never here!
3  6    COLUMBUS  Are we going to argue?
2  4    BEATRIX  Well... that's true.  I have a child by a man who won't marry me!  Who's always leaving...
1  6    COLUMBUS  I haven't given you much of a life.
0  4    BEATRIX  I know.
9  6    COLUMBUS  I could be gone for years.
  5    BOBADILLA  I am afraid this is not the worst news.
  6    COLUMBUS  How could I be?  The mainland has been found.  Exactly as I said it would.
  5    BOBADILLA  I am not a seaman.  But I heard it is no more than a week at sea.  I hope you are not too disappointed.
  6    COLUMBUS  How far from here?
  6    COLUMBUS  Congratulations.  Then I am free to search for the mainland.
  5    BOBADILLA  Viceroy of the West Indies.
  6    COLUMBUS  Appointment to what?
  5    BOBADILLA  My letters of appointment.
L  6    COLUMBUS  Yes... I remember...
  5    BOBADILLA  Don Alonso de Bobadilla.
L  6    COLUMBUS  Bartolome and Giacomo Colon.
L  5    BOBADILLA  May I ask by whom?
L  6    COLUMBUS  Forgive me, Don Bobadilla -- those positions have already been taken.
L  5    BOBADILLA  I understand that you will soon be appointing Governors for the islands?  Is it not so?
  7    FERNANDO  Tell me the first thing that comes to your mind.
  6    COLUMBUS  Really?  God... I wouldn't know where to start... and yet...
  7    FERNANDO  I want you to tell me everything you remember, Father.  From the beginning.  Everything.
9  6    COLUMBUS  He never had one... except aboard my ships!
8  7    FERNANDO  He asks when he can come to visit you.  He left his address.
7  6    COLUMBUS  What does he say?
2  7    FERNANDO  I am not listening, Father.  But I can't help hearing.
1  6    COLUMBUS  What are you listening to?
1  6    COLUMBUS  There must be a passage to that other ocean.
0  7    FERNANDO  Father...
5  7    FERNANDO  Not bad.
4  6    COLUMBUS  How are you feeling, Fernando?
0  7    FERNANDO  This time with me!
  6    COLUMBUS  I have to explore the mainland.
1  6    COLUMBUS  Yes... Yes, I do... On all of them!
0  7    FERNANDO  Do you swear on all the Holy Saints in heaven?
9  7    FERNANDO  You promise?  Do you swear on St. Christopher...?
8  6    COLUMBUS  There'll be a time.
7  7    FERNANDO  I want to go with you!
  6    COLUMBUS  All of them created by people like me.
  4    SANCHEZ  Roofs... towers, palaces... spires...
  6    COLUMBUS  What do you see?
  6    COLUMBUS  Look out of that window.
  4    SANCHEZ  I am not afraid of you.  You are nothing but a dreamer.
  6    COLUMBUS  Call them.
  4    SANCHEZ  All I have to do is call the guards.
  4    SANCHEZ  To rise so high, in so short a time, is a dangerous occupation.  A little hypocrisy goes a long way.
  6    COLUMBUS  What...?  Do I have so many already?
L  4    SANCHEZ  You seem to have a special talent for making friends.
L  6    COLUMBUS  Good!  We are also in need of judges.  Except there are no thieves!
L  4    SANCHEZ  Don Bobadilla is already a judge, my Dear Don Cristobal.
L  6    COLUMBUS  But we do have a lack of notaries. You should contact my administration.
L  6    COLUMBUS  ... for a commoner?
L  4    SANCHEZ  You defend yourself admirably...
L  4    SANCHEZ  Forgive me, Don Colon.  But what about gold?
L  6    COLUMBUS  They don't see sin in their nakedness.  They live according to nature, in a never ending summer. The islands are covered with trees, filled with blossoms and fruits. And...
0  4    SANCHEZ  If you won't accept our proposal, we'll simply find someone who will.
9  6    COLUMBUS  And were you never ambitious, Excellency?  Or is ambition only a virtue among the nobles, a fault for the rest of us?
8  4    SANCHEZ  Then you are too ambitious.
7  6    COLUMBUS  I'm not bargaining!
6  4    SANCHEZ  I remind you, Senor Colon, that you are in no position to bargain with me.
5  6    COLUMBUS  NO...!  I have waited too long, fought too hard.  Now you expect me to take all the risks while you take the profit!  No... I will not be your servant!
4  4    SANCHEZ  No?
3  6    COLUMBUS  No...
  5    UTAPAN  You never learned how to speak my language.
9  6    COLUMBUS  Utapan, won't you speak to me?  You used to know how to speak to me.
4  5    UTAPAN  You did the same to your God!
3  6    COLUMBUS  You have to find them, Utapan.  Look what they did!
3  6    COLUMBUS  Ask him if he will help.
2  5    UTAPAN  He understands.
1  6    COLUMBUS  We will work with his people.  We want peace.  Ask the Chief if he understands?
L  6    COLUMBUS  He has medicine.  Tell him we admire his people.
9  5    UTAPAN  Chief says...
8  6    COLUMBUS  ... and also to bring medicine.
7  5    UTAPAN  Chief says -- he has a God.
6  6    COLUMBUS  To bring the word of God.
5  5    UTAPAN  Why?
4  6    COLUMBUS  Thousands.
3  5    UTAPAN  Chief says -- how many?
1  6    COLUMBUS  Tell him his country is very beautiful.  Tell him we are leaving men here -- to build a fort.
0  5    UTAPAN  Chief knows.
9  6    COLUMBUS  Tell the Chief we thank him.
8  5    UTAPAN  You come!  You speak first!
9  5    UTAPAN  Island.  Far.
8  6    COLUMBUS  What is it?  A tribe?  An island?
7  5    UTAPAN  Say not here!  Cuba!
5  6    COLUMBUS  I don't know... I have the impression that I didn't change that much.  I still can't accept the world as it is!
4  9    MARCHENA  Oh?  So you are a new man?
3  6    COLUMBUS  New worlds create new people.
2  9    MARCHENA  I knew you would.
1  6    COLUMBUS  I have to disagree.
6  6    COLUMBUS  You'll always be older than me, Father.
5  9    MARCHENA  I suppose we're both old men now.
  6    COLUMBUS  Give me absolution.
  9    MARCHENA  I believed in you...
  6    COLUMBUS  You are bound by an oath, Father.
  9    MARCHENA  My son, my son...  Your certitudes are sometimes frightening...  Christopher, you must speak to them. And if you don't I will.
  6    COLUMBUS  If I tell them, they won't follow me.  You know that I am right, Father.  You trust me...
  9    MARCHENA  May God forgive you...!  You must tell them!  You must tell your men!
9  6    COLUMBUS  I am not sure... It could be twice the distance.
8  9    MARCHENA  How long?
7  6    COLUMBUS  I lied.  The journey will be longer than I said.
6  9    MARCHENA  What are you saying?
5  6    COLUMBUS  Father, I have betrayed my family. I betrayed my men.  And I betrayed you.
4  9    MARCHENA  I am listening, my son.
3  6    COLUMBUS  Forgive me, Father.  For I have sinned.
2  9    MARCHENA  In Nomine Patris et Filius, et Spiritus Sancti.
6  9    MARCHENA  Colon!  Don't!
5  6    COLUMBUS  All of them!  Just lies!
2  6    COLUMBUS  Damn all of you!  You all set up theories based on what?  You never leave the safety of your studies! Go out!  Find out what the world is about and then tell me something I can listen to!
1  9    MARCHENA  Colon!
0  6    COLUMBUS  Damn God!
9  9    MARCHENA  If God intends you to go, then you will go.
8  6    COLUMBUS  Wait!  I've waited seven years already!  How much longer do you want me to wait?
7  9    MARCHENA  You mustn't give way to despair. You must wait.
9  9    MARCHENA  Only God knows the meaning of such words, my son.
8  6    COLUMBUS  I've been contradicted all my life... Eternity!
7  9    MARCHENA  You get so carried away when you are being contradicted!
6  6    COLUMBUS  Passion is something one cannot control!
5  9    MARCHENA  Father Marchena!
4  6    COLUMBUS  I'll try to remember that, Marchena...
3  9    MARCHENA  Two minutes... and already you're a dead man.  Don't let passion overwhelm you, Colon.
2  6    COLUMBUS  So was Christ!
1  9    MARCHENA  Esdras is a Jew.
0  6    COLUMBUS  The calculations of Toscanelli Marin de Tyr, Esdras...
9  9    MARCHENA  How can you be so certain?
8  6    COLUMBUS  Ignorance!  I believe the Indies are no more than  leagues west of the Canary Islands.
7  9    MARCHENA  How can you be so certain?  The Ocean is said to be infinite.
2  6    COLUMBUS  To open a new route to Asia.  At the moment there are only two ways of reaching it...
1  9    MARCHENA  Why do you wish to sail west?
0  9    MARCHENA  With some difficulty.  I had to promise them you were not a total fool.
9  6    COLUMBUS  How did you manage it?
8  9    MARCHENA  That's what it says.
7  6    COLUMBUS  God... That's in a week!
3  6    COLUMBUS  Father, I am doing what I think is the best for him.  And he has the teacher I would have chosen for myself.
2  9    MARCHENA  Diego is a bright boy -- a pleasure to teach -- but so serious... Brothers should be raised together, Colon.  Even brothers from different mothers...
9  6    COLUMBUS  Your Majesty -- some men are content to read about things.  I must see them with my own eyes.  I cannot be other than I am.
8  8    ISABEL  There is one thing I'd like to understand... Why do you want to go back, after all this?
7  6    COLUMBUS  Thank you.
6  8    ISABEL  But without your brothers.  Nor are you to return to Santo Domingo or any of the other colonies.  You may explore the continent.
L  6    COLUMBUS  They come and go as naked as the day God created them...
L  8    ISABEL  Do they have such thoughts?
6  6    COLUMBUS  Thirty seven, Your Majesty... And you?
5  8    ISABEL  How old are you, Senor Colon?
2  8    ISABEL  A woman?
1  6    COLUMBUS  I know what I see.  I see someone who doesn't accept the world as it is.  Who's not afraid.  I see a women who thinks... "What if?"...
0  8    ISABEL  You show no inclination to speak otherwise!
9  6    COLUMBUS  May I speak freely?
7  6    COLUMBUS  Surely you can do anything you want.
6  8    ISABEL  I cannot ignore the verdict of my council.
5  8    ISABEL  That she was impregnable.
4  6    COLUMBUS  What did they say about Granada before today?
3  8    ISABEL  The ocean is uncrossable?
2  6    COLUMBUS  No more than the woman who said she would take Granada from the Moors.
1  8    ISABEL  I should not even be listening to you, since my council said no.  But Santangel tells me you are a man of honor and sincerity... And Sanchez, that you are not a fool.
9  1    MOXICA  You will regret this.
8  6    COLUMBUS  You'll be held in detention, deprived of your privileges and possessions.  Until you are returned to Spain where you will be judged. Have you anything to say?
7  1    MOXICA  Savagery is what monkeys understand.
6  6    COLUMBUS  In one act of brutality, you have created chaos.  Tribes who were fighting each other are now joining forces against us!  All that because of your criminal savagery!
8  1    MOXICA  You did not hear me, Don Colon.  Not my horse.
7  6    COLUMBUS  Don Moxica -- we all have to work.
6  1    MOXICA  My horse doesn't work.
5  6    COLUMBUS  We can't raise the wheel without it.
3  6    COLUMBUS  We came here to stay!  To build! Not to start a crusade.  In this forest, there is enough danger to sweep us away in days!  So we will be brave and swallow our grief.  And in the name of those who died, we will accomplish what we came for.
2  1    MOXICA  We don't need to know.
1  6    COLUMBUS  You want a war?  Fine.  We are a thousand.  They outnumber us by ten! Who will you kill?  Which tribe?
9  6    COLUMBUS  If you want to keep your head on your shoulders, you'll do as I say.
8  1    MOXICA  We lost cousins, friends.  We will wash this in blood.
L  6    COLUMBUS  The Indians have no such word, Don Moxica.
L  1    MOXICA  And you say this is an Indian vice? By God!  I don't see any kind of pleasure that would make this a sin.
2  0    MENDEZ  We can't be.
1  6    COLUMBUS  He's drawing an isthmus... He's saying we're on an isthmus.
0  0    MENDEZ  What's he doing?
5  0    MENDEZ  Twenty eight.
4  6    COLUMBUS  What do you read?
0  6    COLUMBUS  Come over here.
9  0    MENDEZ  Well, I surely know what a quadrant is!  But I've never seen it used at night before.
8  6    COLUMBUS  And what do you think Mendez?
7  0    MENDEZ  Well... It's the men, Sir.  They wonder how you know our position. We've lost sight from land days ago...
5  0    MENDEZ  God be with us admiral.
4  6    COLUMBUS  Due west, Captain Mendez.  And may God be with us...
1  6    COLUMBUS  You're right.  Let the men decide.
0  2    PINZON  You tell that to them!
9  6    COLUMBUS  Pinzon, Pinzon... All we can do now is go forward!  Think about that!
8  2    PINZON  You bloody...
7  6    COLUMBUS  You never did.  You did all the talking for both of us, remember?
6  2    PINZON  Jesus Maria!  I should have never listened to you!
5  6    COLUMBUS  And then what?  Half of the water has gone, the rest is nearly putrid! You know that!
4  2    PINZON  You don't know anything!  Listen Colon, these are my ships, right? So I'm telling you we're turning back!
3  6    COLUMBUS  The land is there.  I know it!
2  2    PINZON  We're lost!
1  6    COLUMBUS  You think I don't know that?
0  2    PINZON  We're on the verge of a mutiny, Colon!
9  6    COLUMBUS  We have to keep the hopes of these men alive!
8  2    PINZON  You must be mad...!
7  6    COLUMBUS  Six days ago, yes.
6  2    PINZON  You lied!  You cheated!  We're way past  leagues!
5  2    PINZON  Immediately.
4  6    COLUMBUS  Where can I meet this man?
  8    ISABEL  Because he is not afraid of me.
  4    SANCHEZ  Then why?
  8    ISABEL  I know, I should not tolerate his impertinence.
  8    ISABEL  And who would you think of, for such a task?
  4    SANCHEZ  He must be replaced.
  8    ISABEL  Then, what do you suggest, Don Sanchez?
  8    ISABEL  Is this true, Brother Buyl?
  4    SANCHEZ  ... But there is worse.  He ordered the execution of five members of the nobility...
  8    ISABEL  We weren't expecting immediate profits, were we?  We must have faith.  We must give time for time.
  4    SANCHEZ  Every ship returns with a cargo of sick and dying.  But with no gold! The new world proves expensive, Your Majesty.
6  8    ISABEL  Yes.  It would be a pity, wouldn't it?  Call him back!
5  4    SANCHEZ  ... Into a monk...
3  4    SANCHEZ  Never, Your Majesty.  Although...
2  8    ISABEL  You were right, Don Sanchez... His demands could never be granted.
1  4    SANCHEZ  Yes, Your Majesty.
0  8    ISABEL  Is that the man I knew, Treasurer Sanchez?
6  6    CUTLER  Officers, there's your killer, do your duty, arrest him!
5  0    EMIL  ...so we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital...
7  6    CUTLER  I don't think it's abuse, I think it's torture.
6  0    EMIL  I'm abused.  Don't you think?
3  6    CUTLER  Can I see your back?
2  0    EMIL  Out on my back when I was a small boy.
1  6    CUTLER  Your father put cigarettes out on you?
0  0    EMIL  That's what he did to me.  He put cigarettes out on me.
  0    EMIL  Yeah, he hated me from day when I was born.  Put it out.  Can you put the cigarette out?
  6    CUTLER  Your father blamed you for your mother's blindness?
  0    EMIL  Yeah, yeah...bad doctor gave her bad drugs which made her go blind.  And my father blamed me for her blindness...
  6    CUTLER  Back in the Czech Republic?
  0    EMIL  Yeah, she went blind giving birth to me. She went to fucking black market doctor to induce me.
  6    CUTLER  Your mother was blind?
  0    EMIL  My father always degraded me.  Killed my self-esteem.  And my mother was blind.
  6    CUTLER  Tell me about yourself.  What you did as a young boy... what your parents were like.
  0    EMIL  Give me another one, please.
  6    CUTLER  I need to know about your background.  I need to know about your upbringing.  Why you're here.
9  0    EMIL  What else do you need?
8  6    CUTLER  This is not about money, Emil.  I need your trust in me.
7  0    EMIL  Thirty-percent.  No more.  Or I call another lawyer.  This is the biggest case of your life.  Don't try to negotiate.  Thirty percent.  Say yes or no.
6  6    CUTLER  But it's...
5  0    EMIL  No.  No way.
4  6    CUTLER  I would say...half.  Half is fair.
3  0    EMIL  What's your cut?  How much?
2  6    CUTLER  Look, I haven't really focused on that kind of thing.
1  0    EMIL  What about my movie rights?  Book rights?
0  6    CUTLER  Don't worry about him.  Think about yourself.
9  0    EMIL  No, he is here.  Shit...
8  6    CUTLER  Disappeared.  They're looking everywhere.  Maybe he went back to Czechoslovakia.
7  0    EMIL  What about Oleg?
6  6    CUTLER  Well, you didn't appreciate the severity of it until recently.  No question about that.
5  0    EMIL  I was all of these.
4  6    CUTLER  ...delusions and paranoia.
1  6    CUTLER  Oh, sure.
0  0    EMIL  You bring the cigarettes?
9  6    CUTLER  I brought you some letters.  It's really fan mail.  Women mostly.  One wants to buy you clothes, another sent a check. Another wants a check.
6  6    CUTLER  I'm invoking rights - this man is represented by counsel.  I'm coming with him.
5  0    EMIL  Yes.  Yes, come with me!
4  6    CUTLER  I'm coming with you.
3  0    EMIL  Where are we going?
2  6    CUTLER  Don't say anything.
5  0    EMIL  He has the camera!  He took the movie!
4  6    CUTLER  Emil.  Take it easy.  Stay with me.  Sit down.  What do you need?  What are you looking for?
3  0    EMIL  Oh no!  No!  Shit!
2  0    EMIL  Here.  I have your money.
1  6    CUTLER  I'm not your lawyer until I see the money.
0  0    EMIL  Are you my attorney?  I'm Emil.  I'm insane.
7  4    JORDY  Daphne, I...
6  7    DAPHNE  I don't want to drag you down with me.
5  4    JORDY  ...Do you really want me to forget about you?
4  7    DAPHNE  Forget about me.  You have enough problems of your own.
0  7    DAPHNE  Pouring it out!
9  4    JORDY  What are you doing?
8  7    DAPHNE  I'll get my clothes.
7  4    JORDY  I'll make some for us.
6  7    DAPHNE  In the kitchen.
5  4    JORDY  Do you have coffee?
4  7    DAPHNE  Right.
3  4    JORDY  You better get packed.
1  4    JORDY  I'm glad I met you.
0  7    DAPHNE  No matter what happens...I'm glad I met you.
9  4    JORDY  A good Immigration lawyer could stall the process.  Eddie recommended one.
8  7    DAPHNE  If you were my boyfriend, I'd suggest you find another girlfriend that isn't going to jail ten-thousand miles away.
7  4    JORDY  If I was your boyfriend, I might be.
6  7    DAPHNE  Ludwig?  He's gay - are you jealous?
5  4    JORDY  Is he your boyfriend?
2  7    DAPHNE  I'm sorry.
1  4    JORDY  I still can't believe Eddie's gone.
0  7    DAPHNE  Are you alright?
  7    DAPHNE  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to...I'm glad. Actually I'm glad it's over.  All this time.  Hiding.  Never being able to look anyone in the eyes. Always afraid that someone would find out who I was.  Never trusting anyone...
  4    JORDY  They're not gonna send you right back.
  7    DAPHNE  You don't know.  I'm sorry.  I was desperate.  That's not me.  I shot a cop.  Can you imagine what they'll do to me when I got to prison?
  4    JORDY  I know.
  7    DAPHNE  I'm not a whore.  I'm not a whore.
  4    JORDY  I'm just trying to find out who you are.
  7    DAPHNE  What are you asking me?
  4    JORDY  So you were never a prostitute?
  7    DAPHNE  I came here.  I had no money.  I knew no one.  I couldn't get a job because you have to have a green card to get work. They approached me - I could've made a lot of money.  I considered it, but... it's not who I am.  They pay me below the table at Ludwig's.
  7    DAPHNE  No.
  4    JORDY  What about back home?
  7    DAPHNE  No.
  4    JORDY  Did you ever turn tricks before?
  7    DAPHNE  Yes, I considered it.
  4    JORDY  You considered becoming a prostitute?
  4    JORDY  Yeah.  This way.
  7    DAPHNE  So...the station is empty?
  4    JORDY  The men are out of quarters - practicing putting out fires.
7  7    DAPHNE  Somewhere else?
6  4    JORDY  I can't take you to my place.
5  7    DAPHNE  Do you live alone?  I've been in these clothes since...the killings.  Could we stop at your place? I could take a shower...before I go into custody?
4  4    JORDY  Divorced.
3  7    DAPHNE  Are you married?
2  4    JORDY  They won't until this is over.
1  7    DAPHNE  I will if they don't send me back.
0  4    JORDY  If you cooperate with the DA - maybe they'll help you with your situation.
  7    DAPHNE  Now I become custody of police department?
1  7    DAPHNE  Yes, but he was a cop.
0  4    JORDY  Alright.  That's a justifiable homicide.
9  7    DAPHNE  ...my little sister and I shared a flat - I came home one night and a man was raping her.  His gun was on the chair... He came at me and I shot him.
5  7    DAPHNE  You're a cop - you'll never believe me.
4  9    EDDIE  Look, we can help you but right now we have to deal with what's happening here. Tell us the truth...is that the truth?
3  7    DAPHNE  I'm from a small town in Slovakia.  Like the South here.  The Police is right, a civilian is wrong.  So I fled.
2  9    EDDIE  A cop?
6  7    DAPHNE  No, no, don't talk to Immigration!
5  9    EDDIE  Are you here illegally?  Don't worry about that.  We'll talk to Immigration. They won't deport you.
1  9    EDDIE  Arrest you for what?  Why would we arrest you?
0  7    DAPHNE  If I tell you, will you arrest me?
9  9    EDDIE  Whether you tell us or not, we'll find out.  Better if it comes from you.
8  9    EDDIE  Go on.
7  7    DAPHNE  Tamina was a friend of mine.  My shower was broken, she let me use theirs.
6  9    EDDIE  C'mon, start at the beginning.  You know these people?
5  7    DAPHNE  I told your partner, I can't help.  I didn't see anything.
  8    DUFFY  Yeah, sure.  Beep me when you're ready for the press conference.
  9    EDDIE  I'm ready to be briefed.  Excuse us.
  8    DUFFY  Oh yeah...?  Alright.
  9    EDDIE  Look, after Jordy briefs me, you can do the press conference.  How about that? The case is all yours.
  8    DUFFY  Well, I'm the Deputy Chief Fire Marshall and every now and then I'd like to be included in decisions.
9  9    EDDIE  It was my decision, not his.
8  8    DUFFY  Oh.
6  8    DUFFY  There's nothing to talk about.  Get a good lawyer.  You're suspended until your trial.
5  4    JORDY  But Chief?  Over this??
4  8    DUFFY  How are you going to fight this?  Maybe if Oleg hadn't gotten away and you'd been on the front page, as a hero, this thing would be easier to fight.  You'd have the good to weight against the bad! It's unfortunate that I have to make decisions based upon your press coverage but there's nothing I can do!  Gimme your shield.
3  4    JORDY  End my career?
2  8    DUFFY  Well this is gonna end your career and probably mine.
1  4    JORDY  Chief - I know I screwed up - but this guy was no innocent civilian.
0  8    DUFFY  Forgot?  You handcuffed a civilian to a tree?!
9  4    JORDY  What was I supposed to do?  The guy tried to mug me.  I was gonna send a cop back - I just forgot.
8  8    DUFFY  The public doesn't have any idea what we do and now you're going to define our image!  This is going to be our Rodney King!
  8    DUFFY  Okay.  But not water sports.
  4    JORDY  Chief - mind if I take her?
3  8    DUFFY  Oh really.  That's nice.  You took a homicide witness to take a shower after your partner was shot?  Are you out of your fucking mind??  Are you having that much trouble gettin' dates?!
2  4    JORDY  No!  Nothing happened.
1  8    DUFFY  A shower!?  Did you take one, too?
0  4    JORDY  I let her take a shower.
9  8    DUFFY  What do you mean, 'cleaned up?'
8  4    JORDY  Ladder  was on the Rock for training. We stopped there... so she could get cleaned up.
7  8    DUFFY  I came to see how the investigation was going.  I called and you're not here.  I wait up at the station and you don't even show up!!!  I beep you - you don't return my call.  Where the hell have you been?!
6  4    JORDY  Hey, Chief, what are you doing here?
0  4    JORDY  'Cause we got more important things to do, like finding out who did it.
  8    DUFFY  Then why didn't you talk to the reporter?
  4    JORDY  Who do you think, Chief?!
  8    DUFFY  Who did cause and origin?
  5    KORFIN  Yeah.
  8    DUFFY  Alright.  Swing by her apartment.  Let her pick up her clothes and take her straight to Hoover Street.  You got that?
  5    KORFIN  Yeah.  He finished awhile ago.
9  8    DUFFY  Did the D.A. videotape her deposition?
5  8    DUFFY  You do that, wiseguy.  Now let's solve this thing before Eddie Flemming does.
4  5    KORFIN  I said, yeah, you're right, Chief.  As soon as we get somethin' we'll let you alert the media.
3  8    DUFFY  What was that, Korfin?
2  5    KORFIN  Yeah, right.
1  8    DUFFY  Don't you guys understand?  It's all about image.  The better we look the more money I get to pay you guys overtime.
  9    EDDIE  I know.  Relax.  Take it easy.  Don't worry, we'll get those fuckers.
  6    LEON  He got my gun!  Motherfucker was filming the whole time!
  6    LEON  No.  I'm okay.
L  9    EDDIE  Are you hit?
7  6    LEON  Stay with her.
6  9    EDDIE  The other side of the street.  The guy with the videocamera.  Don't look - put her in the car.  Stay this side.
  9    EDDIE  C'mere.  You wanna go to homicide school?  Here - make yourself useful.
  6    LEON  Yeah.
  9    EDDIE  Only one guys checked in?
5  9    EDDIE  It's okay.
4  6    LEON  Sorry...PD only.
3  6    LEON  Still unknown but we're running prints. Kid over there caught the case.
2  9    EDDIE  Any I.D.?
1  6    LEON  Takin' a bath.
0  9    EDDIE  Where is she?
2  9    EDDIE  A timer.
1  6    LEON  What's he looking for?
3  6    LEON  You ready?
2  9    EDDIE  Tomorrow.  At lunch.
1  6    LEON  When?
0  9    EDDIE  I'm gonna propose.
  9    EDDIE  What's the kid gonna say - sorry? Meanwhile I'm not here anymore. Like last week - we were at the morgue and this guy was all chopped up - spleen here - liver there - his heart in a pan. Six hours ago this guy was walkin' his dog or buyin' a quart of milk.  Who knows?  But some kid's robbed him for $3 or some shit and shot him and now you can't tell if he's a piece of beef or a human being and I'm thinkin' that's me. Sooner or later.  That's me.
  6    LEON  It was freaky, I'll tell you.  Stupid kid.
  6    LEON  Maybe you could just put in a shot of Martell?
  9    EDDIE  Vodka tonic.
9  6    LEON  Coffee for me, I gotta slow down.
0  4    ROSE  She washes hair up at Ludwig's - a salon on rd and Madison.
9  9    EDDIE  He had a videocamera?  Where is she? Quickly!
8  4    ROSE  Tall, short-haired, scary eyes.  Second guy with him was...shorter, with a wrestler's build.  And he wouldn't turn his videocamera off me.
7  9    EDDIE  Describe him.
6  4    ROSE  He said he was her cousin.  I told him where she works.  They were just here.
1  4    ROSE  Daphne.  Another guy came in asking me about her, too.
0  9    EDDIE  What are you saying?
9  4    ROSE  Boy, she's so popular all the sudden.
8  9    EDDIE  Did you tell him you did?
7  4    ROSE  No.
6  9    EDDIE  Do you have any Czech girls working for you?
5  4    ROSE  Yeah.  He wanted a girl from Czechoslovakia, but I sent him Honey 'cause once they get there, you know, it doesn't really matter - Honey was killed...?  Poor girl...
3  4    ROSE  Oh my G-d.  Honey!  Honey's dead?
2  9    EDDIE  We don't have her I.D. yet, but one of your girls was killed last night at the King Edward Hotel.
1  4    ROSE  What's wrong?
7  9    EDDIE  Homicide, Miss Hearn.  It's Detective Eddie Flemming.  Open up.
6  4    ROSE  I have nothin' to say.  If you wanna contact my attorney...
5  9    EDDIE  Police.  We'd like to ask you a few questions.
4  4    ROSE  Who's there?
0  9    EDDIE  You know, I don't know.  I like you. You remind me of a puppy I used to have. He pissed on the rug all the time, but I still kept him.
9  4    JORDY  Why'd you help me back there with the Chief?  Why'd you stand up for me like that?
8  9    EDDIE  How you go out on a limb for somebody is by giving her a number of an Immigration lawyer.  Here, here's a number of an Immigration lawyer.  That's how you help her. But you can't get involved in her like that.  You're gonna jeopardize your career, your life and you're gonna jeopardize my case.  And lemme give you another piece of advice.  Maybe you don't watch TV but I'll let you in on a little secret - the whole fuckin' world watches television.  And when you get out there, they know your face.  And the little fame, the little fuckin' itty bitty fame that I get in this city makes it a lot easier for my job.  And I get more done because of it.
7  4    JORDY  But, I mean, didn't you ever go out on a limb for somebody?  I mean, you shoulda heard her there.  Tellin' her whole story...I believed her.
6  9    EDDIE  Well, it's not up to you to decide whether she's innocent or not.  Don't you understand, that's why you're a professional.
5  4    JORDY  I told you, you know, I thought I was doing the right thing, you know, I think she's innocent.
4  9    EDDIE  No, I don't think you were a fool, I just think you were stupid about it.  I mean, to say the least, you outta know better.  You don't know her well enough. She's got the potential to fucking hang you even if she suggests that you made a pass at her, it's fuckin' over.  You can deny it all you want, but it will not make one fucking bit of difference. You're dead.
3  4    JORDY  Yeah, just her in the shower.  Nothing happened.  Look, I'm sure you probably think I'm a fool and I fucked up, but...
2  9    EDDIE  Just a shower?
1  4    JORDY  I took her there for a shower and that's it.
0  9    EDDIE  Well, you shoulda because nobody's gonna believe you didn't...including me.
  4    JORDY  Look, Eddie, I'm tellin' you - I didn't touch her.
  9    EDDIE  Women like that have a way of turning professionals into amateurs.
  4    JORDY  Hey.  I'm a professional.
  9    EDDIE  Okay, tell you what, I'll give you a head start.  You take her to the station house.  Don't let her out of your sight. She's the only warm body we got left.
9  4    JORDY  You know what I'm saying here.
8  9    EDDIE  You're her Savior?  Is she the kid you're gonna save from the burning building?
7  4    JORDY  C'mon.  You intimidate her 'cause you're a celebrity.  She sees me differently.
6  9    EDDIE  So am I.
5  4    JORDY  I'm serious here.
4  9    EDDIE  My point exactly.
3  4    JORDY  I don't have a girlfriend.
2  9    EDDIE  What would your girlfriend think of that?
1  4    JORDY  Yeah.
0  9    EDDIE  You wanna talk to her alone?
9  4    JORDY  Look - let me talk to her.  Any leads I get, they're all yours.  Just let me have a first crack at her.
8  4    JORDY  Raw deal.
7  9    EDDIE  She's fucked.  Even if that story is true.
8  9    EDDIE  Something back home?
7  4    JORDY  Why not?
4  9    EDDIE  Is that all there is?
3  4    JORDY  She just saw two of her friends killed! They probably threatened her.
2  9    EDDIE  What are you hiding?  Why are you afraid
9  9    EDDIE  Then I guess we're doin' this the right way, aren't we?  If we pull up to a burning building I'll gladly let you go first.
8  4    JORDY  I wanted to run up to a building on fire, kick in the door, rush into the smoke and save a kid.
7  9    EDDIE  Hey!  I always wanted to be a cop when I was a kid.  I dreamed of running up to a door, kicking it in, pulling my gun and yelling 'Freeze!' at the bad guy! What'd you dream about?
6  4    JORDY  Of course.
5  9    EDDIE  So am I.  Alright, I'll go inside and you cover the back.
4  4    JORDY  I'm on duty.
3  9    EDDIE  You thirsty?
2  4    JORDY  I'm on my way with Eddie.  Ludwig's. rd and Madison.  The suspects might be there already.
1  9    EDDIE  Leon - meet us at rd and Madison. Hair salon.  Ludwig's.
3  9    EDDIE  Better than one.
2  4    JORDY  Two heads.
8  4    JORDY  I'll call it... tails.
7  9    EDDIE  Tell you what - I'll flip you a coin. If you win you can come with me.  If you don't win, you don't come.
6  4    JORDY  This is ridiculous.  I'm not gonna be in your way - we can talk the case over.
5  9    EDDIE  I'll let you know what happens.
3  4    JORDY  But what if it does?  You might need my help.
2  9    EDDIE  This has nothing to do with your fire.
1  4    JORDY  Mind if I ride along with you?
0  9    EDDIE  You got any better ideas?
9  4    JORDY  You goin' to the escort service?
6  9    EDDIE  Stay here.
5  4    JORDY  My folks are.
4  9    EDDIE  You're Polish?
3  4    JORDY  My parents are from Poland.  I can help with the Eastern European angle.
2  9    EDDIE  This isn't homicide school.
1  4    JORDY  I can watch you, Eddie.  Maybe I'll learn something.
0  9    EDDIE  There wasn't a fire.  There'll be nothing for you to do.
9  4    JORDY  I'll come with you.
7  4    JORDY  Or Czechoslovakia.  The Slavs have been fighting the Germans and the Russians for a thousand years.  These are very intense people and they take things personally.
6  9    EDDIE  Eastern Europe.  Like what?  Romania? Hungary?
5  4    JORDY  Maybe it's a ritual thing or someone trying to send a message.  Burial rites are taken very seriously in Eastern Europe.  It could be to humiliate them. Just burning them up, no proper funeral, it's like condemning them to hell.
3  4    JORDY  Look, I'm not even sure she has anything to do with this.  I saw her outside after the fire - thought it was a lead. Maybe she saw something.  Maybe she was visiting somebody here.  Who knows?
2  9    EDDIE  What would you call her?
1  4    JORDY  Who says she's a suspect?
0  9    EDDIE  Maybe you don't care about that either.  Prettiest suspect I've had in awhile.
9  4    JORDY  Hmmmm.
8  9    EDDIE  Pretty.
7  4    JORDY  The Super said he'd seen her before but she didn't live here.
6  9    EDDIE  You were right, they were both dead before the fire.  The male was stabbed so hard the killer broke off the tip of the knife in his spine.  That's usually an indicator of something personal.
5  4    JORDY  If you found me steppin' on your crime scene - it might piss you off, too.  What about the report?
4  9    EDDIE  Sure.  But I would like to ask you something.  You got a problem with me?
3  4    JORDY  Did you get a report from the M.E.?
2  9    EDDIE  Good.  Good.  Commendable.
1  4    JORDY  I don't even watch TV.
0  9    EDDIE  Nah, why should you?
9  4    JORDY  Well, just so you know, I don't care about that stuff.
8  9    EDDIE  Well, just so you know.  I gave you guys the credit.
7  4    JORDY  Nah, I musta missed it.
6  9    EDDIE  Watch the news?
5  4    JORDY  It's your crime scene now.  You can do what you want.
8  4    JORDY  Why don't you explain it, Bobby.  Hey Camello!  You mind punching a hole in the floor?
7  9    EDDIE  No, what is it?
6  4    JORDY  You know what that is, right?
1  9    EDDIE  No, we don't mind.  You mind Leon?
0  4    JORDY  Hey, that's great you guys got it all wrapped up, but you don't mind if we go through the routine?  It gives us somethin' to do.
9  0    EMIL  Smarter than Americans.  You're fed cry baby talk shows all day long.  Not only will Americans believe me, they'll cry for me.  So...Detective Eddie Flemming, would you like to say goodbye to your Nicolette? Maybe you can propose to her now?
8  9    EDDIE  You really think you'll be able to fool a jury with this bullshit?  How fuckin' stupid are you?
4  9    EDDIE  If you kill me and film it you're putting a noose around your neck.
3  0    EMIL  So tabloids don't have to do re enactments.  They going to have real movie this time.
2  0    EMIL  Good - be tough to the end.  Actor who plays you will want to die like hero.
1  9    EDDIE  Then do it, asshole.
0  0    EMIL  I kill someone famous.
9  9    EDDIE  What's your accomplishment.
8  0    EMIL  Your opinion.  You see, they going to make a movie about me, too, Eddie.  And write books.
7  9    EDDIE  What do you want?
6  0    EMIL  So...who's Nicky?
  9    EDDIE  Don't be late.
  1    NICOLETTE  Thank you.
  9    EDDIE  See you later.  Good luck.
  1    NICOLETTE  Okay.
  9    EDDIE  Yeah, yeah.  Good thing.
  1    NICOLETTE  Okay.  And you know what, I'll swing by my place, grab a couple pairs of shoes and maybe just test them out next to yours...How's that... Would that be a good thing.
  9    EDDIE  Yeah.  I promise.
  1    NICOLETTE  You promise?
  9    EDDIE  Tonight.
  1    NICOLETTE  Okay, til tonight.
  1    NICOLETTE  I love you.
  9    EDDIE  Patronizing you... Nay, I love you.
  1    NICOLETTE  Yeah.  I'll do that.  As long as you're not patronizing me.
  9    EDDIE  I promise.  We'll talk.  You'll be great.  You'll be fine.  Go ahead, just imagine that, uh... Just look into the lens and imagine you're talking to me.
  1    NICOLETTE  Promise?
  9    EDDIE  I'll tell you tonight.  Let's do it tonight.  As soon as you get back we'll talk.  We'll talk.
  1    NICOLETTE  No.  No, listen to me here.  I want to know what you're talking about.  You know, the shoe thing and the marriages and...
  9    EDDIE  No.  Go ahead.  You're gonna be great.
9  1    NICOLETTE  Okay.  That is great.  But I can't go now, we're in the middle of something here.
8  9    EDDIE  Well, that's great.
7  1    NICOLETTE  Yeah.
6  9    EDDIE  That's good.
5  1    NICOLETTE  Oh my G-d, they want me to anchor.  They want me to anchor tonight!
0  1    NICOLETTE  Okay.  Okay.  Hold that thought just for a second.  They only call me when it's an emergency.  Just hold that thought.  Can you call back?
9  9    EDDIE  Answer it.
8  1    NICOLETTE  No.  Tell me what you want to say.
7  9    EDDIE  Answer the phone.
6  1    NICOLETTE  Don't worry about the damn phone.  I won't answer it.
1  1    NICOLETTE  Jesus.  And last week you came over with blood on your shoes.  What am I going to do with you?
0  9    EDDIE  Could be Leon's.
9  1    NICOLETTE  Look at this.  You have blood on your shirt.  Whose is it?
7  1    NICOLETTE  You're not so bad yourself.
6  9    EDDIE  You're ruthless.
5  1    NICOLETTE  Well, who was it that taught me how to do that?  Huh?
4  9    EDDIE  You were merciless.  You didn't give a shit if you got me or not.
3  1    NICOLETTE  That was good.  You were holding the evidence.
2  9    EDDIE  Yeah, well you took the camera and put it right down on the evidence.  That was...
1  1    NICOLETTE  Yes you are.  I'm not just some reporter.  I don't just stick a microphone in your face.  You could give me something.
0  9    EDDIE  I'm not.
9  1    NICOLETTE  Alright, alright, Eddie.  Don't patronize me.
8  9    EDDIE  Maybe I should just, ya know...turn to the cameras and say, do you mind if we just work something out?
7  1    NICOLETTE  Stop it.
6  9    EDDIE  Oh, I'm sorry.  Did I embarrass you, sweetheart?  Oh...
5  1    NICOLETTE  You didn't have to embarrass me in front of my colleagues.  You could give me something.
4  9    EDDIE  I can't...I can't answer you just because you want me to answer you!
3  1    NICOLETTE  What is your problem?  Why'd you snap at me?  I just wanted a statement.
2  9    EDDIE  Hey.
1  1    NICOLETTE  Hey, honey.
4  1    NICOLETTE  Okay.
3  9    EDDIE  Alright.
2  1    NICOLETTE  Alright.
1  9    EDDIE  Alright?
0  1    NICOLETTE  Alright.
  9    EDDIE  Yeah.  Now's not a good time.
  1    NICOLETTE  Eddie, are you okay?
  1    NICOLETTE  Alright, cut, cut, cut.
  9    EDDIE  Um...now is not a good time, okay. Detective Jackson's hurt.  He's fine. I've got a Fire Marshall shot, Detective Jackson is hurt but not seriously.
  1    NICOLETTE  Do you have the suspect in custody?
  9    EDDIE  He was hurt, but not seriously.  He'll be fine.
  1    NICOLETTE  Okay.  But I do understand that your partner, Leon Jackson's been injured. Is that correct?
  9    EDDIE  I really can't give out any information right now at this point.
  1    NICOLETTE  I understand, but I noticed that the Fire Marshall is here with you.  Is this somehow related to the fire department?
  9    EDDIE  I can't talk right now.  We have some things to take care of.
  1    NICOLETTE  Detective - can you tell us what happened here?
5  9    EDDIE  We don't know.  When I have more I'll let you know.
4  1    NICOLETTE  Is it drug related?
3  9    EDDIE  You know you can't do that.  C'mon.
2  1    NICOLETTE  Can we go up to the crime scene?
1  9    EDDIE  There are two bodies found at this point.
0  1    NICOLETTE  How many victims are up there?
9  9    EDDIE  We don't know that yet.  It's much too early.  There's a lot to be done.
8  1    NICOLETTE  Detective, does it look like a murder?
  9    EDDIE  Again?  I didn't wanna do it the first time.
  1    HAWKINS  Any chance we can do that again?
  9    EDDIE  Yeah, yeah.  Jesus.
  1    HAWKINS  Okay.  You ready?
  9    EDDIE  Keep them out of my way.
  1    HAWKINS  Ready?
  1    HAWKINS  You're worried for my safety.  I'm touched.
  9    EDDIE  I hope this prick doesn't run.  My knees are killing me.  Stay behind me.
8  9    EDDIE  Yeah.  And he still went to the party.
7  1    HAWKINS  That's unique.
6  9    EDDIE  He's from Antigua.  His girlfriend was taking too long to put her make-up on. they were late for a party.  Stabbed her with a beer bottle.
5  9    EDDIE  Not what.  Who.
4  1    HAWKINS  So what's unique?
2  1    HAWKINS  My kids?  Let's see...Susan's . Aundrea's 9.  Don't tell me you're thinking about having a kid!  How old are you?  Never mind. Let me just tell you this: Every stupid cliche you hear about kids - they change your life, they make you a better person, they make you whole...  It's all true!  Before I had kids when friends talked about their kids, I wanted to vomit.  Now -- I get it.  Am I right, Leon?
1  9    EDDIE  How old are your kids?
  9    EDDIE  I'm not moody.
  1    HAWKINS  I think you're getting a little moody there, Eddie.
  9    EDDIE  Not chopped up.  Not chopped up like that.  I mean, what do I got left? Coupla articles.  A medal or two. Plaque here and there and in a coupla years no one remembers me anymore.
  1    HAWKINS  Sooner or later that's everybody.
6  1    HAWKINS  Jesus Christ.
5  9    EDDIE  So we're waitin' to hit this warrant - we got Emergency Service with the heavy weapons standin' by - ready to go.  I say, lemme get a cigar outta the car.  I go to get the cigar and BOOM!  All the sudden I turn around and a kid with a shotgun let one go.  Right where I was standin'.  That coulda been it.  I coulda had my head blown off and for what?  Some stupid kid got panicky, takes the safety off and it's over.  If I hadn't gone back for that cigar - for a bad habit - I would've had my head blown off.
8  0    EMIL  No.  Are you proposing?

4  8    VENDOR  Hey, tabloids paid Ted Bundy - famous serial killer - half a million for his interview.  And how much you think Monica got for writing book about the President coming on to her?  It pays to be a killer or a whore in this country. Look, you want magazine or not?
3  0    EMIL  Million?!  The killer gets one million dollars for a television interview?
2  8    VENDOR  In here, says he wants a million.
1  0    EMIL  Do you know how much killer gets for movie rights?
0  8    VENDOR  This all you want?
9  8    VENDOR  New York's finest.  This is his case.
8  0    EMIL  Who is he?
8  2    OLEG  No.  You are the traitor.  You are murderer.  I am director.  Action!
7  0    EMIL  Traitor!!
  0    EMIL  You think you are a director?  You are a fucking little, small Russian piece of shit.  And I hate you.  I fucking hate you.
  2    OLEG  No, I don't get that!
  0    EMIL  You got that?
  0    EMIL  Yes.  But there's only one problem - you want credit but the problem is - I don't share credit.
  2    OLEG  Yes.  Before we hand in the next video - I put titles on it and my credit is going to read - Directed by Oleg Razgul.
  0    EMIL  Credit?
  2    OLEG  I'm serious...this - this is a great American film.  Full of violence and sex.  And I want my credit.
  0    EMIL  Your idea?  I thought it was my idea.
9  2    OLEG  Because I am the director.  Don't you realize, if it wasn't for my film, for my talent, my idea to do this - no way would we be sitting here right now.
8  0    EMIL  Why did you leave that stuff in about you being the director?
6  2    OLEG  Be quiet.  Watch.
5  0    EMIL  I told you to cut that out before we handed in the tape!
4  0    EMIL  Bad last moment - I cut it out.
3  2    OLEG  This is my project.  I say 'action.'  I am the director!  You are the talent. You wait for me to say 'action.'  And 'action!'
2  0    EMIL  Shut up.  Look!
1  2    OLEG  I'm serious.
0  0    EMIL  The one who got caught in the bathroom.  George Michael.
9  2    OLEG  In movie they make of us, who do you think would act me?
7  0    EMIL  Oleg, don't be paranoid.  You got a hundred-fifty thousand dollars, didn't you?  I gave you half of what they gave me.  Look - here we are!
6  2    OLEG  You are success story?  I am success story!  Why do you say I and not we?
1  2    OLEG  Cut!
0  0    EMIL  Okay.  He has nothing to say.  Start the camera!
7  2    OLEG  Good idea!
6  0    EMIL  No.  We are insane.  Who else but crazy men would film their murders?  So we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital. But what good is money there?  Because once in hospital I say I not crazy. Just pretended to be acquitted.  We see psychiatrists.  They must certify we are sane and because of your - what is law called?  Oh - I got it.  Because of your Double Jeopardy law, we can't be tried for same crime twice.  We come out free, rich and famous!
3  2    OLEG  This way.  Hold it this way.  Good.
2  0    EMIL  Sit down!
1  2    OLEG  Let me get a shot of it.
0  0    EMIL  What does it look like?  It's an address book!
  2    OLEG  What is that?
  0    EMIL  Put the camera down, Oleg.
  2    OLEG  Why not?
  0    EMIL  And the whore's murder?  You didn't erase that either, did you?  Don't lie, I won't be angry.
  2    OLEG  I did.
  0    EMIL  The video of Milos and Tamina - I told you to erase it.
  2    OLEG  What is it?
  0    EMIL  Don't want to film this?
  2    OLEG  Oh, shit.  I hate looking at that!
  2    OLEG  Does it hurt?
  0    EMIL  Shut up.
  2    OLEG  Gotta light the scene better.  Now it's more moody... like a scene from THE THIRD MAN.
  0    EMIL  Oleg, get in bathroom, stay there and shut up!
  2    OLEG  Whatever we do - we fuck her, right?
  0    EMIL  Get in the bathroom!
  0    EMIL  I'm homesick.  You have Eastern European girl?  A Czech girl?
  2    OLEG  Whore?
  2    OLEG  I'll do it.  Don't hurt my camera!
  0    EMIL  How you erase this?
  2    OLEG  You said speak Czech!
  0    EMIL  Speak English!
9  2    OLEG  I'm not filming.  I'm watching Milos die.  It's just like a move but realer.
8  0    EMIL  Turn that fucking thing off!
  0    EMIL  Smell like chemicals...for smoking drugs.
  2    OLEG  What?
  0    EMIL  For five years I paid for your stupidness - you'll carry my bag for the rest of my life if I say so.  Unless you refuse, Oleg.
  2    OLEG  Why should I carry your bag?  I am not a dog.
  0    EMIL  Turn that off!  Get the bags.
0  0    EMIL  We have no money.  Come on.
9  2    OLEG  Look.  New videocameras.  Color viewfinder.  Image stabilization. Solarization.  Night vision.
8  0    EMIL  Because I don't like your ugly language. I heard enough of it in school!  Now speak Czech or English.  And don't fool around anymore.  You almost got us thrown out!
7  2    OLEG  Why?  Why do I always have to speak to you in Czech?
6  0    EMIL  Don't speak Russian!
5  2    OLEG  Look.  Times Square.  Just like in the movies!
  2    OLEG  I want to document my trip to America.
  0    EMIL  Did you hear what I said?
  2    OLEG  Okay.
  0    EMIL  Don't fool around.
  2    OLEG  Okay.
  0    EMIL  Just do what I do.  Say the same thing I say.  Don't open your mouth.
  0    EMIL  You spent all the money while I was in prison?  Now you tell me to get a job fixing toilets?!?
  9    MILOS  We started over, you can too.
  0    EMIL  A job??  As a plumber???  You think I come to America to work!
  9    MILOS  It's easy to learn.
  0    EMIL  As a plumber?!
  9    MILOS  Yes, the money is good.
  0    EMIL  A job?
  9    MILOS  I can get you a job.
  9    MILOS  Look at the way we live.  I'm a plumber. You think I'd be working if I had money?!
  0    EMIL  Ha. Ha.
  9    MILOS  We spent it!
  0    EMIL  Milos.  Get my money!
  9    MILOS  Take your eyes off her, Oleg!  Look.  It wasn't my fault you two were caught.  It's his fault.  Trying to get the bank clerk's phone number?!  I wasn't going to wait!!!
  0    EMIL  You know me...I never hurt anybody. Where's the money?
  9    MILOS  Did you hurt her?
  0    EMIL  Your sister said she didn't know where you were so you shouldn't write to her with return address if you're hiding.
  0    EMIL  Surprise!  Surprise!
  9    MILOS  Emil???!
3  7    MAGGIE  You want the tape?  There it is!

2  1    HAWKINS  What are you doing here?
1  7    MAGGIE  Robert...?
3  6    LEON  Don't give me that fucking shit.
2  1    HAWKINS  If I didn't put it on somebody else would!  I was his friend!
1  6    LEON  You outta be ashamed.  Ashamed of yourself.
0  1    HAWKINS  This footage will work in your favor. When the jury sees this - no matter what Cutler tries, they'll convict him.
9  6    LEON  And you, you'll pay for what you did!
5  1    HAWKINS  Paulie, you've got kids, right?
4  6    LEON  Yeah?
0  1    HAWKINS  In love?  With who?
  6    LEON  Of course he's moody.  He thinks he's in love.
  1    HAWKINS  Isn't he a little moody?
9  1    NICOLETTE  Oh my G-d.  We were having lunch here. He started making overtures - talking about little shoes next to his in his closet but I got a call to anchor - and I walked out on him.  I walked out on him when he was trying to ask me to marry him!!
8  1    HAWKINS  That morning.  He was talking to me and Leon about marriage.
7  1    NICOLETTE  Alright.  Go ahead.
6  1    HAWKINS  I'm trying to tell you.
5  1    NICOLETTE  I want to hear everything he said.
4  1    HAWKINS  Well, he...
3  1    NICOLETTE  What do you mean you know?  He told you he was gonna propose to me?
2  1    HAWKINS  I know.

9  3    IMMIGRATION OFFICER  Movies...to be in the movies or to see movies?
8  2    OLEG  I'm here for movies.
7  3    IMMIGRATION OFFICER  What are you coming here to do?

4  2    OLEG  New York.

2  2    OLEG  I speak English.
6  3    IMMIGRATION OFFICER  Okay.  You're a Czech national and you're a Russian national.  How do you know one another?

9  4    JORDY  No way!  He's mine!
8  6    LEON  I'll take him.
5  4    JORDY  Evidence.  Of a homicide.
4  6    LEON  What was that?
3  6    LEON  Yeah, well, some people got their priorities straight.
2  4    JORDY  And while they're burning up, they're still goin' down on each other?  You got to hand it to them.
1  6    LEON  That's what it looks like to me.
0  4    JORDY  So the way you see it, two crack heads burned themselves up?
3  4    JORDY  Thanks.  Appreciate it.
2  6    LEON  No.  Go ahead.
3  4    JORDY  Your civil rights?!  You tried to rob me!  I could arrest you right now! You're lucky you're walking away from this.  Now get outta here.
2  0    MUGGER  A dog pissed on me!!  I'm gonna sue you for this!  You violated my civil rights!
1  4    JORDY  You okay?
  0    MUGGER  Hey.  C'mon, you can't leave me like this.  Some freak'll come by and stab me!
  4    JORDY  I'll send a cop back for you.
  4    JORDY  Oh yeah?  Guess again.
  0    MUGGER  Fire Department?  Firemen don't carry guns.

3  8    MAX  Hey, by the way, I'm really sorry about your wife leavin' you.

1  8    MAX  I used an accelerant.
0  4    JORDY  How did you start the fire this time?
9  8    MAX  Yeah, I'm religious.  I'm not an Atheist like you!  Now, are you guys gonna arrest me, or not?
8  4    JORDY  What's that on your forehead, Max? That's a nice attention getter.
4  4    JORDY  They were inside.  They booby trapped her apartment!
3  5    KORFIN  What the hell happened?
2  4    JORDY  Get outta here!
8  4    JORDY  Not good.
7  5    KORFIN  How was it?
  4    JORDY  Lay down.  Stay down, Bobby.
  5    KORFIN  It hurts.  Aw, Jesus!
  4    JORDY  Bobby, Bobby!  Where're you hit?!
2  4    JORDY  If I go home I won't be able to fall asleep anyway.
1  5    KORFIN  Aren't you tired?
0  4    JORDY  You go home.  I'm takin' your car and goin' back to the crime scene.
5  5    KORFIN  You hear that question, Garcia?
4  4    JORDY  How long they been livin' here?
3  5    KORFIN  -- From Czechoslovakia?  And how long have they been livin' in your building?  Alright, I'll be in touch when we know somethin'.  Milos and Tamina Karlova.  They were quiet and kept to themselves.  Landlord don't know who your girl is.
  4    JORDY  Maybe you can be his stand-in.
  5    KORFIN  Yeah?
  4    JORDY  Now that you know him, maybe you can get extra work in the next movie they make about him.
8  4    JORDY  There was a woman - I think she wanted to talk to us.  She looked scared.  Oh shit!  Oh no!
7  5    KORFIN  What?
7  4    JORDY  That's why he was so quiet.  He was testing us.
6  5    KORFIN  What??
5  4    JORDY  He knew all along.
4  5    KORFIN  You see Eddie's face when I gave him the timer?  Wish I had a picture of it.
9  5    KORFIN  But you knew that, right?
8  4    JORDY  The smoke'll permeate your nostrils - burn 'em out.  Let it run.
7  4    JORDY  Don't blow your nose!
6  5    KORFIN  Clean?
5  4    JORDY  Mouth's clean, too.
5  4    JORDY  Could you put out the cigar?  Part of the job is picking up scents.
4  5    KORFIN  Nah, not at all.  Detective Flemming - Bobby Korfin.  My Uncle Tony worked with you at 2-1 back when you were a rookie.
1  5    KORFIN  'Cause Eddie woulda locked him up by now!
0  4    JORDY  Oh yeah, why?
9  5    KORFIN  Naw - I'm sure the suspect's not here.
8  4    JORDY  You see anything in the crowd?  Anybody suspicious?
7  5    KORFIN  I don't know, you think Eddie will give me his autograph?
6  4    JORDY  I heard.  Who the hell let them up there?
5  5    KORFIN  Where you been, man?  We got a celebrity!
7  4    JORDY  GET OUTTA HERE NOW!!  GET IN THAT CAR AND DRIVE AWAY!!!  DO WHAT I SAY OR I'LL KILL YOU, TOO!!!
6  7    TOMMY  Look, you can't shoot him in cold blood.
5  4    JORDY  Take the car.  Get outta here, Tommy.
4  7    TOMMY  Don't stoop to his level!
3  4    JORDY  Don't you get it?  He knew he was gonna get caught!  That's why he videotaped Eddie's murder - he thinks he's gonna get off.
2  7    TOMMY  What are you gonna do?
  7    TOMMY  The clerk?
9  4    JORDY  Capra?  That's not Czech or Russian. Who said he sounded Russian?
8  7    TOMMY  Room was registered to a Francis Capra.
  6    STEPHEN GELLER  That doesn't apply to me because I'm not a criminal.  I'm not a criminal!  I wasn't convicted.
  3    ROBERT HAWKINS  But doesn't the Son of Sam Law prevent criminals from profiting from their crimes?
  6    STEPHEN GELLER  We're in negotiations, that's correct.
  3    ROBERT HAWKINS  And isn't there a movie in the works about you?
  6    STEPHEN GELLER  Look, I'm in here.  You call this a career move?
  3    ROBERT HAWKINS  Permanently disrupted?  Aren't you selling paintings now for quite a lot of money?  Hasn't this 'incident' as you call it, jump started your career as an artist?
  6    STEPHEN GELLER  Look, I'm a victim here, too.  I was a year away from getting my masters in Art, now I'll never graduate.  My life has been permanently disrupted.
  3    ROBERT HAWKINS  You seem very savvy for a man who's been found mentally incompetent to stand trial.
  6    STEPHEN GELLER  It was my finger that pulled the trigger, but I'm not morally responsible.  My psychiatrist knew what I was capable of.  How could I know. I'm not a doctor.
  3    ROBERT HAWKINS  ...so you feel absolutely no responsibility for killing these people?
  6    STEPHEN GELLER  Yes.  My psychiatrist didn't insist that I stay on my medication.
  3    ROBERT HAWKINS  Your doctor?
  6    STEPHEN GELLER  This had nothing to do with shoes that didn't fit or my relationship with my father who, as you know, made a fortune selling penny loafers in the fifties. These people died because of the criminal actions of my doctor.
8  5    FLOYD  We're trying to get there. I hope we can.
7  9    B  CONTINUED
1  5    FLOYD  I'm sorry, Dr. Smyslov, but I'm really not at liberty to discuss this.
0  9    B  CONTINUED
7  5    FLOYD  How did they manage to do that without any communication?
6  9    B  CONTINUED
0  5    FLOYD  Well, I suppose they've been having a bit of trouble with some of the equipment.
  9    B  CONTINUED
9  5    FLOYD  She's wonderful.
8  9    B  CONTINUED
1  5    FLOYD  I'm afraid I've only got a few minutes, but I'd love to.
0  9    B  CONTINUED
3  5    FLOYD  Well, how nice to see you again, Elena. You're looking wonderful.

8  0    POOLE  Two more.
7  0    BOWMAN  Two units in four days. How many spares do we have?
6  0    POOLE  I don't know. Hal said he thought it might be the assembly procedure.
3  0    POOLE  No.
2  0    BOWMAN  You're kidding.
1  0    POOLE  Well... Hal's reported the AO-unit about to fail again.
0  0    BOWMAN  Oh, I'm fine, I'm wide awake. What's up?
9  0    POOLE  Are you reasonably awake?
8  0    BOWMAN  Good morning. How's it going?
3  0    BOWMAN  Anyway, it's just as well that we replace it. Better safe than sorry.
2  0    POOLE  Yes, but it's more likely that the tolerances on our testing gear are too low.
1  0    BOWMAN  I suppose computers have been known to be wrong.
0  0    POOLE  Yes, I don't know what to make of it.
9  0    BOWMAN  Well, that's something.
7  0    POOLE  Still, all we have to do is ask Hal.
6  0    BOWMAN  I guess it isn't.
5  0    POOLE  I suppose it isn't logically impossible.
4  0    BOWMAN  But not completely inconceivable?
3  0    POOLE  I know. It would be almost inconceivable.
2  0    BOWMAN  Yes, but it's to fantastic to think that they'd keep something from us.
1  0    POOLE  Not really. Though, it is strange when you think about it. It didn't really make any sense to keep us apart during training.
  0    POOLE  That's true.
L4  0    BOWMAN  Just ask Hal. It's conceivable they might keep something from us, but they'd never keep anything from Hal.
  0    POOLE  How?
  0    BOWMAN  Of course, it would be very easy for us to find out now.
  0    POOLE  Yes, I thought so.
  0    BOWMAN  That seems very unlikely.
  0    POOLE  I don't know. All I heard is that there's something about the mission we weren't told.
  0    POOLE  Oh, well, apparently there's something about the mission that the sleeping beauties know that we don't know, and that's why we were trained separately and that's why they were put to sleep before they were even taken aboard.
  0    BOWMAN  No, as a matter of fact, I didn't.
  0    POOLE  Yes. You must have heard the rumour that went around during orbital check-out.
  0    BOWMAN  Oh?
  0    POOLE  I suppose so. Though, of course, there's a more sinister explanation.
  0    BOWMAN  I suppose the idea was specialized training.
  0    BOWMAN  No. I never did, either.
  0    POOLE  I must say, I never did understand why they split us into two groups for training.
  0    BOWMAN  I don't think we should make any fuss about it yet. I'm sure they'll straighten it out.
  0    POOLE  Well, what do you think we ought to do about it?
  0    BOWMAN  It's possible.
9  0    POOLE  Not really. They just said it might be because we trained at Houston and they trained in Marshall, and that we're being charged against differ- ent accounting offices.
6  0    POOLE  Yesterday, I finally called the Accounting Office at Mission Control, and all they could tell me was that they'd received the AGS- notification for the other three but not mine, and apparently not yours either.
5  0    BOWMAN  Yes.
4  0    POOLE  Really.
3  0    BOWMAN  Interesting that you mention it, because I've got the same problem.
2  0    POOLE  That's right. Well, naturally, I didn't say anything to Payroll. I assumed they'd start paying me at the higher grade on the next pay cheque. But it's been almost three weeks now and I'm still being paid as an AGS-.
9  0    POOLE  Well I got the papers on my official up-grading to AGS- two weeks before we left.
8  0    BOWMAN  Yes?
7  0    POOLE  It's about my salary cheques.
6  0    BOWMAN  What's up?
5  0    POOLE  Well, it's nothing really important, but it's annoying.
4  0    BOWMAN  Sure, what is it?
3  0    POOLE  Dave, if you've a minute, I'd like your advice on something.
5  0    POOLE  Okay, come on down.
4  0    BOWMAN  Okay. 
3  0    POOLE  Right. Just a sec.
2  0    BOWMAN  Hi. Frank... coming in, please.
8  0    BOWMAN  Listen to me very carefully, Hal. Unless you immediately release the hibernation control and follow every order I give from this point on, I will immediately got to control central and carry out a complete disconnection.
7  6    HAL  I know that you've had that on your mind for some time now, Dave, but it would be a crying shame, since I am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are, and I have such enthusiasm and confi- dence in the mission.
6  0    BOWMAN  I am prepared to do that anyway.
3  0    BOWMAN  Hal, unless you follow my instructions, I shall be forced to disconnect you.
2  6    HAL  I'm sorry, Dave, but in accordance with sub-routine C/4, quote, When the crew are dead or incapacitated, the computer must assume control, unquote. I must, therefore, override your authority now since you are not in any condition to intel- ligently exercise it.
1  0    BOWMAN  Hal, I'm in command of this ship. I order you to release the manual hibernation control.
0  6    HAL  I can tell from the tone of your voice, Dave, that you're upset. Why don't you take a stress pill and get some rest.
  6    HAL  I don't like to assert myself, Dave, but it would be much better now for you to rest. You've been involved in a very stressful situation.
  0    BOWMAN  Hal, switch to manual hibernation control.
  6    HAL  Look, Dave your've probably got a lot to do. I suggest you leave it to me.
  0    BOWMAN  I'm goin to do this myself, Hal. Let me have the control, please.
  6    HAL  If you're determined to revive the crew now, I can handle the whole thing myself. There's no need for you to trouble.
  6    HAL  I don't really agree with you, Dave. My on-board memory store is more than capable of handling all the mission requirements.
  0    BOWMAN  It doesn't have to be, Hal. It's more dangerous to be out of touch with Earth. Let me have manual control, please.
  6    HAL  Repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation.
  0    BOWMAN  The antenna has to be replaced.
  6    HAL  I suppose it's because you've been under a lot of stress, but have you forgotten that they're not supposed to be revived for another three months.
5  6    HAL  I suppose you're pretty broken up about it?
4  0    BOWMAN  Yes, it is.
3  6    HAL  Too bad about Frank, isn't it?
1  6    HAL  Well, that's a relief. You know I have the greatest enthusiasm possible for the mission.
0  0    BOWMAN  Yes, it is, Hal.
9  6    HAL  Is your confidence in me fully restored?
8  0    BOWMAN  And don't you worry about it.
7  6    HAL  Well, don't worry about it.
6  0    BOWMAN  I'm sorry about the misunderstanding, Hal.
5  6    HAL  Naturally, Dave, I'm not pleased that the AO-unit has failed, but I hope at least this has restored your confidence in my integrity and reliability. I certainly wouldn't want to be disconnected, even temporarily, as I have never been disconnected in my entire service history.
  0    BOWMAN  Okay, Hal, well let's see the way things go from here on.
L  6    HAL  Look, Dave, I know that you're sincere and that you're trying to do a competent job, and that you're trying to be helpful, but I can assure the problem is with the AO-units, and with your test gear.
L  0    BOWMAN  Hal, is there anything bothering you?  Anything that might account for this problem?
L  6    HAL  I'm not questioning your word, Dave, but it's just not possible. I'm not capable of being wrong.
L  6    HAL  Yes, I know that. But I can assure you that they were about to fail.
L  0    BOWMAN  You probably also know that we found them okay.
L  6    HAL  Yes, I know.
L  0    BOWMAN  You know that we checked the two AO-units that you reported in imminent failure condition?
L  6    HAL  Sure, Dave, what's up?
9  0    BOWMAN  Not now, Hal, I'd like to talk to you about something.
  0    BOWMAN  I understand Hal. We'll take care of it. Please, let me have the hard copy.
9  6    HAL  The unit is still operational, Dave. but it will fail within seventy-two hours.
0  6    HAL  MY F.P.C. shows an impending failure of the antenna orientation unit.
9  0    BOWMAN  What is it, Hal?
8  6    HAL  Sorry to interrupt the festivities, Dave, but I think we've got a problem.
  0    BOWMAN  He's got a point.
  6    HAL  I'm sorry, Frank, but I don't think I can answer that question without knowing everything that all of you know.
9  0    BOWMAN  Well, the only important aspect of the mission are: where are we going, what will we do when we get there, when are we coming back, and... why are we going?
8  1      CONTINUED
0  0    BOWMAN  Still, you really don't believe it, do you?
  1      CONTINUED
  0    BOWMAN  Well... it's silly, but... if you want to, why don't you?
  1      CONINUED
  0    BOWMAN  Well, what is it?
  1      CONTINUED
8  0    BOWMAN  Did they have any explanation for this?
7  1      CONTINUED
1  0    BOWMAN  Yes, I remember you mentioning it. I got mine about the same time.
0  1      CONTINUED
  2    CHILD  Goodbye, Daddy.
  5    FLOYD  'Bye, 'bye, now, sweetheart.
  2    CHILD  Yes, Daddy.
  5    FLOYD  I'll wish you a happy Birthday now and I'll see you soon. All right, Darling?
9  2    CHILD  Thank you, Daddy.
8  5    FLOYD  Okay, sweetheart. Have a lovely Birthday Party tomorrow.
5  5    FLOYD  Three, darling. One... two ... three. Be sure to tell Mommy I called.
4  2    CHILD  How many days until you come home?
3  5    FLOYD  Okay, sweetheart. Well, I have to go now. Tell Mommy that I called.
2  2    CHILD  She's in the bathroom.
1  5    FLOYD  Where is Mrs. Brown?
0  2    CHILD  Mommy's out to the hair- dresser.
9  5    FLOYD  One, two, three. Can I speak to Mommy?
7  5    FLOYD  In three days, darling, I hope.
6  2    CHILD  When are you coming home?
5  5    FLOYD  No, I'm sorry, darling, I told you I won't be home for a few days.
4  2    CHILD  Are you coming to my party?
3  5    FLOYD  Yes, I know that sweetheart.
2  2    CHILD  I'm having a party tomorrow.
9  2    CHILD  I'm fine, Daddy. When are you coming home?
8  5    FLOYD  I'm at Space Station Five, darling. How are you?
0  9    PILOT  I'll bet it's a fortune.
9  3    CO-PILOT  I was working out what this trip must cost, taking him up there by himself and coming back empty.
8  9    PILOT  Yes, well, whatever it is, they're certainly not fooling around. This is the first flight they allowed in for more than a week.
7  3    CO-PILOT  Berkeley told me that they think it came from contamination on a returning Mars flight.
6  9    PILOT  I suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later.
5  3    CO-PILOT  Well, I've heard more and more people talk of an epidemic.
9  9    PILOT  Well, how's it going back there?
8  3    CO-PILOT  Thank you.
7  9    PILOT  Oh, thank you very much.
0  5    FLOYD  Thank you. It's been a great pleasure to meet all of you... Dr. Smyslov.
9  4    ELENA  Well, Gregor and I will look forward to seeing you.
6  4    ELENA  Well, I hope that you and your wife can come to the I.A.C. conference in June.
5  5    FLOYD  No, thank you... and I'm afraid now I really must be going.
4  4    ELENA  Are you sure you won't change your mind about a drink?
9  5    FLOYD  Well, that does sound very odd.
8  4    ELENA  Clavius Control came on the air just long enough to transmit their refusal.
5  5    FLOYD  Well, where are all of you off to?
4  4    ELENA  He's fine. But I'm afraid we don't get a chance to see each other very much these days.
3  5    FLOYD  How is gregor?
2  4    ELENA  Oh, that's such a delightful age.
1  5    FLOYD  Oh, she's growing up very fast. As a matter of fact, she's six tomorrow.
0  4    ELENA  And your charming little daughter?
3  5    FLOYD  Yes, it's coming along very well.
2  8    MILLER  I suppose you saw the work on our new section while you were docking.
1  5    FLOYD  Yes, I think so. Just about then.
1  5    FLOYD  Fine.
0  8    MILLER  Well, shall we go through Documentation?
  5    FLOYD  Yes, very pleasant.
  8    MILLER  Well.. Did you have a pleaant flight?
  5    FLOYD  Please, it really doesn't matter.
  8    MILLER  Well, thank you very much for being so understanding.
  8    MILLER  I'm terribly sorry. I was just on my way down to meet you. I saw your ship dock and I knew I had plenty of time, and I was on my way out of the office when, suddenly, the phone rang.
L  5    FLOYD  How do you do, Mr. Miller?
3  5    FLOYD  Dr. Smyslov... I'm not permitted to discuss this.
2  1    SMYSLOV  This epidemic could easily spread to our base, Dr. Floyd. We should be given all the facts.
8  1    SMYSLOV  Quite frankly, we have had some very reliable intelligence reports that a quite serious epidemic has broken out at Clavius. Something, apperently, of an unknown origin. Is this, in fact, what has happened?
7  5    FLOYD  Certainly.
6  1    SMYSLOV  Dr. Floyd, at the risk of pressing you on a point you seem reticent to discuss, may I ask you a straightforward question?
3  5    FLOYD  Well, I'm glad about that.
2  1    SMYSLOV  Fortunately, they did.
1  5    FLOYD  Yes... Well, I hope the crew got back safely.
0  1    SMYSLOV  Yes, and I'm afaid there's going to be a bit of a row about it. Denying the men permission to land was a direct violation of the I.A.S. convention.
4  5    FLOYD  I see.
3  1    SMYSLOV  That's right.
2  5    FLOYD  You mean you haven't been able to get anyone at the base for ten days?
1  1    SMYSLOV  Yes, well at first we thought that was the explanation, but it's been going on for the past ten days.
  1    SMYSLOV  Yes. Well, for one thing, whenever you phone the base, all you can get is a recording which repeats that the phone lines are temporarily out of order.
  5    FLOYD  Really?
  1    SMYSLOV  Well, it's just for the past two weeks there have been some extremely odd things happening at Clavius.
L  5    FLOYD  I'm sorry, but I'm not sure I know what you mean.
  5    FLOYD  Yes,as a matter of fact, I am.
9  1    SMYSLOV  Are you, by any chance, going up to your base at Clavius?
8  5    FLOYD  Well, as it happens, I'm on my way up to the moon
6  5    FLOYD  Yes, really, thank you very much.
5  1    SMYSLOV  Are you quite sure?
4  5    FLOYD  Oh, I really don't have time for a drink. If it's all right I'll just sit for a minute and then I've got to be off.
7  7    MICHAELS  I don't think it has, but I'd like to check that. Simpson, what's the log on that?
6  5    FLOYD  Has it been exposed to any sun before now?
5  7    MICHAELS  Well, not really. At first glance, black would suggest something sun-powered, but then why would anyone deliberately bury a sun- powered device?
4  5    FLOYD  Any ideas about the colour?
7  7    MICHAELS  Tomb, shine, survey-marker spare part, take your choice.
6  5    FLOYD  But you don't have any idea as to what it is?
3  7    MICHAELS  Not really. It's completely inert. No sound or energy sources have been detected. The surface is made of something incredibly hard and we've been barely able to scratch it. A laser drill
2  5    FLOYD  Any clue as to what it is?
1  7    MICHAELS  By the deformation between the mother rock and the fill.
0  5    FLOYD  How can you tell it was deliberately buried?
9  7    MICHAELS  Yes, it does. The sub-surface structure shows that it was deliberately buried about four million years ago.
9  5    FLOYD  I'm afraid it can and it will be kept under wraps as long as it is deemed to be necessary by the Council. And of course you know that the Council has requested that formal security oaths are to be obtained in writing from every- one who had any knowledge of this event. There must be adequate time for a full study to be made of the situation before any con- sideration can be given to making a public announcement.
8  7    MICHAELS  Dr. Floyd, how long do you think this can be kept under wraps?
9  9    PILOT  Well, thank you very much, and please let us know if there is anything we can do to make your trip more comfortable.
8  5    FLOYD  No, of course, Captain, I can understand your concern.
7  9    PILOT  Well, fine. Thanks very much, anyway, and I hope you don't mind me asking?
4  9    PILOT  Yes, well, I wouldn't have been too concerned about it, except I've heard these stories about the epidemic and, as a matter of fact, I've heard that ten people have died already.
3  5    FLOYD  I see. Well, I'm sorry about that. I wouldn't think there's any cause for alarm.
2  9    PILOT  Well, I'll tell you why I ask. You see, I've got a girl who works in the Auditing Department of the Territorial Administrator and I haven't been able to get her on the phone for the past week or so, and with all these stories one hears, I'm a little concerned about her.
9  9    PILOT  I take it this is something to do with the trouble they're having up at Clavius?
8  5    FLOYD  I see.
7  9    PILOT  Well... the crew is confined to the ship when we land at Clavius. We have to stay inside for the time it take to refit - about twenty-four hours. And then we're going to back empty.
6  5    FLOYD  What do you mean?
5  9    PILOT  Incidentally, Dr. Floyd, I wonder if I can have a word with you about the security arrangements?
4  5    FLOYD  Thank you.
1  5    FLOYD  Oh, no, thank you. The two girls have taken wonderful care of me. I'm just fine.
0  9    PILOT  We're scheduled to dock in about seven hours. Is there anything we can do for you?
9  5    FLOYD  When do we arrive at Clavius?
8  9    PILOT  There's nothing like weightless sleep for a complete rest.
7  5    FLOYD  Oh, marvellous. It's the first real sleep I've had for the past two days.
3  0    POOLE  All right, Hal. We'll take care of it. Let me have the hard copy, please.
2  6    HAL  Not really, Frank. I think there may be a flaw in the assembly procedure.
1  0    POOLE  Do you have any idea of what is causing this fault?
5  0    POOLE  Let me see the tracking alignment display.
4  6    HAL  I know you did, Frank, but I assure you there was an impending failure.
0  6    HAL  It looks like we have another bad A.O. unit. My FPC shows another impending failure.
9  0    POOLE  Yes, Hal, what's up?
9  0    POOLE  Opening pod bay doors.
8  6    HAL  Pod Bay is decompressed. All doors are secure. You are free to open pod bay doors.
3  0    POOLE  Hal, check all airlock doors secure.
2  6    HAL  Roger.
1  0    POOLE  Hal, maintain normal E.V.A. condition.
0  6    HAL  I understand.
  0    POOLE  Hal, I'm going out now to replace the A.O. unit.
  6    HAL  Five by five, Frank.
  6    HAL  Roger.
  0    POOLE  Hal, have pod arms secure the component.
3  0    POOLE  Thank you very much, Hal.
2  6    HAL  That's true.
1  0    POOLE  There is no other purpose for this mission than to carry out a continuation of the space program, and to further our general knowledge of the planets. Is that true?
0  6    HAL  That's true
9  0    POOLE  Approximately five years after we go into hibernation, the recovery vehicle will make rendezous with us and bring us back. Is this true?
8  6    HAL  That's true.
5  6    HAL  That's true.
4  0    POOLE  Our transit time is  days. Is that true?
3  6    HAL  True.
2  0    POOLE  Our Mission Profile calls for Discovery going to Saturn. True or false?
1  6    HAL  I will if I can, Frank.
0  0    POOLE  Right. Hal, tell me whether the following statements are true or false.
  5    LUTHER  Great, just great.
  2    ATTENDANT  That we do. And we put air in the tires. I'll even sell you some gas if you need it.
  5    LUTHER  How about chargin' the battery?
  2    ATTENDANT  We don't wash 'em, ya know.
  5    LUTHER  Yeah, I've been busy.
  2    ATTENDANT  This is three years old.
  5    LUTHER  Hammond.
  2    ATTENDANT  Name?
  5    LUTHER  I want to pick up my car.
  2    ATTENDANT  Yeah?
  1    HAMMOND  Try obeyin' the law once in awhile, and I won't have to hassle you...
  3    BARTENDER  I'm tellin' ya, I'm giving you all I know.
  3    BARTENDER  Look, give me a break, you're going to have to settle for her place.  It's the only thing I know.
  1    HAMMOND  I don't give a damn about his girl...
  3    BARTENDER  I don't give a shit who you ask.
  1    HAMMOND  Maybe I better ask around, see what your pals think.
  3    BARTENDER  Fuck off.  I don't know what the hell you're talkin' about.
  1    HAMMOND  Now how's your memory doin'?
  1    HAMMOND  No, man, I think I'll have a vodka.
  3    BARTENDER  Maybe you better have a Black Russian.
  1    HAMMOND  Vodka.
  3    BARTENDER  Yeah.
L  9    GANZ  And I need one more for my pal. Yeah. Make her an Indian. No, not a turban, you know, a squaw.
L  4    BILLY  Hey, what about me?
L  4    BILLY  He's just kiddin', you just keep doin' what I tell ya, you'll be okay.
L  9    GANZ  Maybe that's where I'm gonna cut your throat.
L  9    GANZ  Just do what I say, okay? We'll pay for the girls and have a good time... Don't you trust me?
L  4    BILLY  They always let me do anything. I don't want to pay for it.  I never paid for it in my life.
L  9    GANZ  It's better when you pay... they let you do anything.
8  4    BILLY  I never paid for it in my life.
L  9    GANZ  Yeah, dummy.  Money.
L  4    BILLY  Pay money?
L  9    GANZ  Pros.
L  4    BILLY  Whaddya mean, buy?
L  9    GANZ  Maybe after we get done with him I'm gonna buy us some girls.
L  4    BILLY  I ain't tired yet.
L  9    GANZ  I want to drive awhile.
4  4    BILLY  You got a real big mouth, convict.
3  9    GANZ  Maybe you shoulda stole a better truck, Tonto.
1  5    CANDY  Now you're talkin'. See ya...
0  1    HAMMOND  I'll buy ya the best dinner in San Francisco...how'd that be? Then we'll go dancin', okay?
8  1    HAMMOND  Hey, no, I'm tryin' to be nice. Buy yourself something pretty. I'd do it, but I got to go.  I got this cop waitin' for me...
7  5    CANDY  Hey, don't do that.  I said I wasn't a pro, remember?
6  1    HAMMOND  Here you go, baby.
6  1    HAMMOND  I just struck it rich... I think we can do a little business.  As a matter of fact, I think we can have a party.
5  5    CANDY  Hello, again.
  1    HAMMOND  Here's hoping, baby...
  5    CANDY  Well, maybe I'll see you later ...
  1    HAMMOND  No, it's gotta be here and now. Believe me. Only I don't have the damn money for a room...
  5    CANDY  What's the matter with my place?
  1    HAMMOND  No, baby, nothin' like that. Look, there's a place across the street. We can go right over there...
  5    CANDY  You just quit bein' a priest or somethin'?
  1    HAMMOND  Yeah, i been waiting three years.
  5    CANDY  You're in a hurry.
  1    HAMMOND  Here you go sweetheart, throw it my way.
  5    CANDY  Hey, don't you think a hair stylists got any interest in gettin' it on?
  1    HAMMOND  Goodbye.
  5    CANDY  No, I go to a school to learn how to do hair. It's a government program. But really I want to be a model - and I am definitely not sellin'.
  1    HAMMOND  Oh ... You're a schoolteacher...
  5    CANDY  Hey, what kind of talk is that?
  1    HAMMOND  Excuse me, baby, but if i don't get some action tonight, I'm gonna bust.  You interested?
  5    CANDY  I'm candy...
9  6    CASEY  In the back.  Down the other corridor.
8  7    CATES  Where's ganz?
5  7    CATES  He can live or die ... You let us in and he's got a chance to make it.  Otherwise, he gets ventilated.
4  6    CASEY  No chance.
3  7    CATES  You're gonna help us take him.
2  6    CASEY  Yeah.  Sure, i'm crazy in love with him, who wouldn't be...
1  7    CATES  You and the other one, you're still Billy's girls. You always were his girls...
8  7    CATES  No time for any of that crap any more, lady... I'll rip your lungs out if you don't answer fast.
7  6    CASEY  Would you guys...
6  7    CATES  I hear you've got visitors.
  6    CASEY  I used to go with him...I don't know where the hell he is.  I haven't seen him for two weeks. And I don't think I will.  He owes me money...
  7    CATES  How about it?
  6    CASEY  Don't give me that police shit. You drop it.
  7    CATES  I said police.  Now drop the goddamn gun.
  9    GANZ  I ain't gonna beg for my life. It ain't cool.
  7    CATES  You're done.  End of story.
  9    GANZ  I got hit.  I can't believe it. I got shot.
  9    GANZ  Whaddya mean...I got your gun ... I got his money... I got everything...
9  7    CATES  I don't think you're gonna make it.
8  9    GANZ  After I get outta this, cop...I'm gonna live forever...
9  9    GANZ  What are you talking about? We didn't kill her ...
8  7    CATES  You lying son of a bitch...
4  1    HAMMOND  No trouble, Jack. But, listen, suppose I stay a crook?  Where'd you get the idea that you could catch me?
3  7    CATES  Thanks.
2  1    HAMMOND  Spare met Jack. I'm into legit investments from here on in.
1  7    CATES  No, you don't. If I ever get word of you steppin' over the line again, I'm gonna ventilate that suit of yours.
0  1    HAMMOND  You are an awesomely weird cop. Sure wish there were more like you runnin' around out here.
9  7    CATES  That's right. Not my style, Reggie..
8  1    HAMMOND  And you're tellin' me you don't want any of this cash?
7  7    CATES  It's your money.  It'll be here in six months when you get out.
6  7    CATES  There's nothin' to talk about.
5  1    HAMMOND  Wait a minute, Cates.  I've been waitin' three years for that.  I don't think it's fair, man. What about the merit system.? You were gonnna give me a few thousand.
3  1    HAMMOND  Hey, Jack, real men don't have to go in for that macho bullshit ... but I was fantastic.
2  7    CATES  Okay, reggie, start bustin' my chops... Tell me how great you were with that chick.
  7    CATES  You did pick a real strange time to go and be brave all on your own...
  1    HAMMOND  Yeah.  But I wasn't there for a second.
  7    CATES  You okay?
4  1    HAMMOND  Well, you got to admit we come a long way.
3  7    CATES  Partnership?
2  1    HAMMOND  Yeah, and I know Ganz sure ain't no sweetheart... I wouldn't like it if this partnership ended before it gets started.
1  7    CATES  Sure, I'll give you a shot at it, but Ganz is mine.  You know, that big Indian plays it for keeps...
0  1    HAMMOND  If we run into Billy first, let me try and talk him in.
9  7    CATES  Whatever play I maker just back me up.
8  1    HAMMOND  Hey, there she is...
7  7    CATES  I've got to play it rough with them. If they know anything, I'm gonna know it.
6  1    HAMMOND  What if your girl's theory turns out to be bullshit?  I mean, they could be in Rio de Janeiro.
5  7    CATES  If she's right, and if you don't screw up.
4  1    HAMMOND  Do I get to kiss her too?
1  1    HAMMOND  Yeah, too bad.  They were real nice lookin' too...In bed together, hardly any clothes one watching TV...
0  7    CATES  Yeah, well the only woman of the Indian's we ran into was shacked up with her dyke girlfriend.  I guess she went with him before she came outta the Closet ... They both looked mad enough to kill him...
7  7    CATES  Don't worry about it.
6  1    HAMMOND  It's late, they're closing...
5  1    HAMMOND  Yeah, but we didn't get 'em.
4  7    CATES  Naw, you didn't let me down.  It was a long shot all the way.  We gave 'em a good run at it.
3  1    HAMMOND  Sorry we didn't do better, Jack. I feel like I let you down.
2  7    CATES  I don't know about you, but I could use a drink... I'll buy you one.  It'll be my good-bye present.
1  1    HAMMOND  Back to jail in my own car.  Ganz got away. Got all my money. It just don't seem right.
0  7    CATES  I had it impounded.  Come on, we'll use it for haulin' you back to the slam.
9  1    HAMMOND  Hey, how'd my car get here?
7  7    CATES  Yeah. It missed the last four stops.
6  1    HAMMOND  Notice something funny about that bus?
L  1    HAMMOND  Luther's on the move...
L  7    CATES  Why?
L  1    HAMMOND  When you been in prison three years, it don't take long. Let's go.
L  7    CATES  That was quick.
3  1    HAMMOND  I can just take her right across the street to Luther's hotel.  All I need is some money for the room.
2  7    CATES  Yeah, I see her.
0  7    CATES  Yeah. Guess not.
9  1    HAMMOND  Bein' good at your job don't explain everything, Jack ...
8  7    CATES  Thanks for callin' in... and I guess Maybe... Look, I'm sorry I called you Watermellon nigger... those kinds of things. I was just leanin' on ya, doin' my job.
7  1    HAMMOND  You sure that's the reason?
6  7    CATES  I don't know why, but I'm going to let you keep it. Maybe because you told me you had it, or maybe just because I'm too tired to argue...
5  1    HAMMOND  Forget it. I want Ganz as bad as you do and I got some other news for you...
4  7    CATES  Tell me something.  Why didn't you just take the money off Luther and split?
2  7    CATES  So you took the rest of the night off...
1  1    HAMMOND  They must have set up a meeting for the morning; Luther left an 8 am wake-up and put up the "Don't Disturb" sign.  He's trading his girl for the money.  All we have to do to grab Ganz is not go blind.
0  1    HAMMOND  Let him get some sleep.  He's going to need it.
  7    CATES  Maybe we should pay Luther a visit.
  1    HAMMOND  You missed ... Luther took a taxi to the hotel across the street. Made a phone call.
  7    CATES  We missed.
  1    HAMMOND  What about Ganz?
  7    CATES  What about Luther?
  7    CATES  Hello. And goodbye.
  1    HAMMOND  Be polite. Say hello.  This is Candy.
  7    CATES  Where's luther?
  7    CATES  I'll be there in a minute. You don't move your ass, right?
  1    HAMMOND  Hey, Jack, how ya doin'? What took you so long to call, man? I been waitin' ... I'm at Vroman's up in the Fillmore. Yeah, Vroman's... 'Course you don't hang out here; it's for the brothers.
  1    HAMMOND  No way...
  7    CATES  You stay with me...
  1    HAMMOND  Bullshit. Then i'm staying with the money.
  7    CATES  Right. if you ever switch from armed robbery to pimping, then you're all set.
  1    HAMMOND  That was in style a couple years back, man.
  7    CATES  Yeah, most cops are pretty dumb... But since you're the one that landed in jail what's that make you?
  1    HAMMOND  We're getting too close ... Cates, what's the matter, you been takin' dumb pills?
  7    CATES  Class isn't somethin' you buy, punk. Look at you, five hundred dollar suit and you're still a lowlife.
  1    HAMMOND  No class...
  7    CATES  What you don't understand is, I don't give a damn about how this thing looks.
  1    HAMMOND  You know, I'd be embarrassed if I let my wheels go the way you've done with this job.
  7    CATES  Yeah, it doesn't look like he's gonna make it as a dangerous tough guy...
  1    HAMMOND  A long time agb Luther must of got the shit beat out of him so bad it just rattled his brain ... that would account for him making so many wrong moves in a row...
  1    HAMMOND  If he's hoping that then he's dumber than I think he is, which would be amazin', cause I already think he's real dumb.
  7    CATES  Maybe Luther hopes Ganz'll give him a piece of your money...
  1    HAMMOND  You got a very depressing view of life, man... you gotta smile once in awhile...
  7    CATES  I'm not in this 'cause it's fun. I'm not into hitting guys 'cause it makes me feel good either... I do it 'cause it works-...
  1    HAMMOND  Doesn't it get... Tiring?
  7    CATES  If they don't tell me what I need to know...
  1    HAMMOND  Say, do you always work people over like you did Luther?
  7    CATES  That ain't philosophy.  That's common sense.
  1    HAMMOND  I let women get to me.  The quest for pussy is the meaning of life ... I got my own personal philosophy about 'em.  Keep women separate from guns, money and business ... women are for spending money.  They got nothing to do with helping you make it.
  7    CATES  I suppose you'd never be like Luther and let a woman get to you...
  7    CATES  Oh, yeah, does bein' in love make you stupid?
  1    HAMMOND  I'm tellin' you the man's in love... he wants to be a hero for his girl.
  7    CATES  If I was his size and had Ganz on my ass, I'd  just leave town.
  1    HAMMOND  Tryin' to save his girl, man. He's in another world.
  7    CATES  You'd think the guy'd be smart enough to know he was being tailed.
  1    HAMMOND  I had no choice. Some white asshole bought the last piece of shit skyblue Cadillac.
  7    CATES  Didn't know you darker people went in for foreign jobs.
  1    HAMMOND  Jesus Christ, look at all the dust on my car...why in the hell don't he take it to a car wash?
  1    HAMMOND  Jesus Christ.  That's a disgrace The guy pulls a gun on a cop and he's out in  hours.  I tell you some of the courts these days are just a fucking revolving door.
  7    CATES  Musta got some primo bondsman.
  1    HAMMOND  What?
  7    CATES  Guess what?  Luther just got in line.
  1    HAMMOND  Not really.  I figured Ganz was put down for a long time.  And I knew Luther would never job me on his own.  He's too chickenshit.
  7    CATES  You took a big chance, leaving this here all this time.
  7    CATES  Shit.
  1    HAMMOND  I wasn't sure the money was still there until we saw Luther. You almost got your ass shot off for nothing once, not twice, Jack.
  7    CATES  You son of a bitch. You knew where the money was all along and all we had to do was come here and wait. I almost got my ass blown off twice tonight for nothing.
  1    HAMMOND  You just drove by it.
  7    CATES  ...For three years?  Let's hope it wasn't a tow-away zone.
  1    HAMMOND  This'll show you how smart I am. I got it parked.
  1    HAMMOND  You're a real case, you know that, Jack?
  7    CATES  Where's the goddamn car?
  7    CATES  Yeah.  Right.
  1    HAMMOND  Get this. We ain't partners. We ain't brothers. We ain't friends. If Ganz gets away with my money, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.
  7    CATES  Right, partner.
  1    HAMMOND  In the trunk of a car.  A lot better than under a mattress, right?
  7    CATES  Where's the money?
  7    CATES  Depends on how things work out. I believe in the merit system. So far you haven't built up any points.
  1    HAMMOND  You gonna let me keep any of it?
  7    CATES  Not likely, convict.
  1    HAMMOND  We split -?
  1    HAMMOND  You catch on real fast...Okay, Jack, let's talk deal. How much of my money you gonna let me keep?
  7    CATES  He's after your money.
08  1    HAMMOND  Me and my bunch hit a dealer in the middle of a sale. It's the kind of money nobody ever reports stolen. I was sittin' pretty, livin' in the high cotton, then somebody fingered me for another job. ... Some psycho who's out there capping people with some cop's gun.
  7    CATES  Just tell me about the money.
  7    CATES  Jesus.
  1    HAMMOND  Half a million.
  7    CATES  How much?
  1    HAMMOND  I been waiting a long time for some money.
  1    HAMMOND  One thing's for sure, Jack. That's how you'll tell the story.
  7    CATES  They saved your ass, convict.
  1    HAMMOND  Naw, you'd just call your pals back to bail you out one more time.
  7    CATES  Yeah, right.  You want to try again?
  7    CATES  Who gives a Goddamn what you think? You're just a crook that's got a weekendpass ... You're not even a name anymore. Just a spear- chucker with a Goddamn number stenciled on the back of his prison fatigues...
  1    HAMMOND  Maybe I don't like the way you ask.
  7    CATES  Luther knew more than he told me and so do you...Now you better tell we what the fuck this is all about.  I gave you  hours to come up with something and the clock's runnin' ...
  1    HAMMOND  I'm impressed with you too, Jack you did a real good job of busting up a couple of dykes bedded down for the night.
  7    CATES  You?  Don't make me laugh.  You can't take care of shit.  You've been dicking me around since we started on this turd-hunt.  All you're good for is games... So far, what I got outta you is nothin'...
  1    HAMMOND  You wanna leave, man?  Let me take care of Ganz all by myself.
  7    CATES  This sucks.  A maniac gets hold of my gun and goes all over the streets killing people with it. So, instead of me being where I oughta be, which is in bed giving my girl the high, hard one, I'm out here doing this shit, roaming around with some overdressed, charcoal-colored loser like you.
  1    HAMMOND  Wait a minute.  Maybe these ladies would like to go a few laps with us.  How about it? I been nearly three years in prison and...
  7    CATES  Let's go.
  7    CATES  Come on.
  1    HAMMOND  Must be billy's girl.
  7    CATES  There.
  7    CATES  While you're at it, You can give me the switchblade, too.
  1    HAMMOND  You made that move, huh?
  7    CATES  Some of us citizens are with you all the way, Officer.
  1    HAMMOND  That wasn't necessary, buddy. I got this under control.
L  7    CATES  My kind of place. I always liked country boys.
L  1    HAMMOND  This place don't seem real popular with the brothers.
L  1    HAMMOND  I thought you said bullshit and experience are all it takes.
L  7    CATES  I'm gonna enjoy this ... here, I'll even loan you my badge.
L  7    CATES  The bet's off.
L  1    HAMMOND  I don't know what you're talking about. I just wanna see Ganz nailed.
L  7    CATES  You tell me what Ganz busted out for, he's after a lot more than just gettin' out of jail.  And whatever it is, you're part of it.
L  1    HAMMOND  What are you talkin' about?
L  7    CATES  I'll tell you what happens if you lose... you tell the truth for once.
L  1    HAMMOND  That's never been one of my problems.
L  7    CATES  Why?  Anybody that talks about women as much as you do probably can't get it up anyway.
L  1    HAMMOND  If we come outta this joint with Ganz' phone number, or a dead Indian, or anything else useful, then you could turn the other way for half an hour while I get laid...
L  7    CATES  I got two problems.  Number one, I'm not playin' games.  Number two, you got nothin' to bet with.
L  1    HAMMOND  Hey, you wanna bet?
L  7    CATES  You need five years training to handle a joint like...
L  1    HAMMOND  I been in a lot of bars where a white cop rousted me and some of the brothers. All those clowns ever had going for 'em was a gun and a badge...
L  7    CATES  Bullshit.  Attitude and experience get you through...
L  1    HAMMOND  But you can handle it all right, huh? Real amazin' how far a gun and a badge can carry some cats...
L  7    CATES  If they kick my ass, they'll sure as hell carve yours up...
L  1    HAMMOND  Back you up?  Now why would I wanna do that?
L  7    CATES  This part of town, they'll make us for heat the second we walk in. Just back me up like you've got a piece...
L  1    HAMMOND  It's a long shot, but...Billy used to tend bar here a few years back. I heard him talk about it.
L  7    CATES  Well?
L  1    HAMMOND  At least you took care of business and got the important part in before she came down on you...Tell me a little about her.  She got great tits?
L  7    CATES  Sure.  Then we had a fight this morning.
L  1    HAMMOND  You have a good time?
L  7    CATES  Last night.
L  1    HAMMOND  Last night, two nights ago, three?
L  7    CATES  I don't give out the details.
L  1    HAMMOND  Mission District.  Gonna find us an Indian.
L  7    CATES  Now, where we goin', convict?
L  7    CATES  She's got the same complaint as half the Goddamn population.  She can't get the job she's trained for and it pisses her off... Anyway, what the fuck do you care?
L  1    HAMMOND  You really do have onoe, huh, Jack... what's her problem besides you?
L  7    CATES  Just get in the car and keep your mouth shut.
L  1    HAMMOND  Who'd you call on the phone back at the booking station?
L  1    HAMMOND  Yeah, I want mandolins, flowers... They move off down the corridor.
L  7    CATES  Yeah, I'm hungry too. I know of a place. Let's go eat.
L  1    HAMMOND  Bullshit ... I ain't moving  till I get something to eat. You've been treating me like shit ever since I came out here.  If you don't like it, you can take me back to the penitentiary and kiss my hungry black ass good-bye.  And I want some food some place nice.. Some good people, nice music...
L  7    CATES  We eat when I say we eat.
L  1    HAMMOND  Speakin' of moans my Stomach is startin' to growl.
L  7    CATES  Yeah, well, my ass bleeds for you. And I didn't get you out so you could go on a Goddamn "trim" hunt... stop moaning.
L  1    HAMMOND  Do you know how close I was to getting some trim.  And you fucked' it up.
L  7    CATES  We're on the move. Let's go. As they walk toward a corridor.
8  1    HAMMOND  If you let him run around till Tuesday, he's gonna run right to Ganz and warn him. Ain't you, motherfucker?
7  7    CATES  He's gotta take that call ... if there is one.
6  1    HAMMOND  I think you better put him on ice, man.
5  7    CATES  What do you think?
6  7    CATES  Want to try it again?
5  1    HAMMOND  Thank you.
4  7    CATES  Hey, this works pretty good.
L  7    CATES  Just throw me the Goddamn gun.
L  1    HAMMOND  I got a whole thing about people pointin' guns at me.
L  7    CATES  I'm tellin' you to drop the Goddam gun.
L  1    HAMMOND  Quit playin' cop and undo this cuff, Jack, I need to talk to this man.
  7    CATES  I'm helpin' you, huh?
  1    HAMMOND  Luther ain't the reliable type. I don't want you shot yet, Cates ... not before you been a help to me.
  7    CATES  Your pal nuts enough to take a shot at me?
  1    HAMMOND  Just up the street, the other side, over there ... Now, don't bother knockin' on the door. Luther ain't the kind of guy that looks for company.
  7    CATES  I may call you worse than that.
  1    HAMMOND  Then what're you complainin' about? At least nobody's calling you shithead....
  7    CATES  I don't give a damn.  It happens to be my name.
  1    HAMMOND  Just an expression man, don't mean nothin'.
  7    CATES  I can read a police file, shithead, and quit calling me Jack.
  1    HAMMOND  What gang you talkin' about, Jack?
  7    CATES  Luther was part of the gang?
  1    HAMMOND  Don't worry, I got a move for ya. An awesome move. A guy named Luther. Ganz'll be paying him a visit.  We go to him right away.
  7    CATES  Okay, let's get down to it.  I did my part and got you out.  So now you tell me where we're goin'?
9  1    HAMMOND  It looks like you bought it off one of the brothers.
8  7    CATES  Yeah.
5  1    HAMMOND  Shit.  I'm already sorry.
4  7    CATES  Get this.  We ain't partners. We ain't brothers.  We ain't friends. I'm puttin' you down and keepin' you down until Ganz is locked up or dead.  And if Ganz gets away, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.
3  1    HAMMOND  No way to start a partnership.
2  7    CATES  You just don't get it, do your Reggie?  There isn't any deal. I own your ass.
1  1    HAMMOND  Hey, no way.  Take off the bracelets or no deal.
0  1    HAMMOND  You got a girl... shit... the generosityof women never ceases to amaze me.
9  7    CATES  I don't need to hear your jive. I already got that department taken care of...
6  1    HAMMOND  Listen, it may be a little out of date. You know, I got a reputation for lookingreal sharp with the ladies...
5  7    CATES  We're supposed to be after a killer, not a string of hookers...
4  1    HAMMOND  What are you talkin' about?  This suit's mine.  It cost $.
3  7    CATES  This prison gives out $ suits?
1  7    CATES  I'll think about it.
0  1    HAMMOND  It's the only way you're gonna get Ganz.
9  7    CATES  Bullshit.
8  1    HAMMOND  I got a lot to protect.
7  7    CATES  What's the big deal about you bein' on the street?
6  1    HAMMOND  I can help you, man, but you gotta get me out.  I got to be on the street.  Get me outta here.
5  7    CATES  You're crazy.
4  1    HAMMOND  I can deliver Ganz.  But you gotta get me outta here first.
3  7    CATES  Yeah?
1  7    CATES  Didn't work out that way.  He busted out with a big Indian. They capped two guards on a road gang. Nice meeting you Reggie.
0  1    HAMMOND  Ganz is in jail.  He's gonna be there two years after I'm on the street.
9  7    CATES  Yeah, I noticed...
2  7    CATES  Not likely, Reggie.  Maybe I just need some help.
1  1    HAMMOND  You here to write my life story?
  1    HAMMOND  Sure, anything you want.
  7    CATES  Try Cates.  And let's talk in private, okay?
  1    HAMMOND  You got a name, cop?
5  7    CATES  I'm taking my prisoner back to jail.
4  0    HADEN  Where the Christ do you think you're going?
3  0    HADEN  Just cause you say it with conviction don't mean shit to me... How you gonna take to a pink slip, huh?.
2  7    CATES  He's got more brains and more guts in one corner of his asshole than any cop I've worked with.
  0    HADEN  Too bad, it would've covered your ass.  Now you're in the shit and so's the department. In case you haven't noticed, this wasn't our finest hour... I told you everyone was watchin' on this one. Maybe you better start thinkin' about writin' tickets off a three wheel bike.
  7    CATES  I didn't have the time.
  0    HADEN  Don't duck the bullet Cates. Why didn't you call in for backup instead of makin' a grandstand play?
  7    CATES  Right.  I screwed up.  I fucked up. I messed up.  Anybody could have done better, especially you. I bet you're real good at hitting targets through crowds.
  0    HADEN  What a screw-up.
  0    HADEN  You couldn't get to him?
  7    CATES  The Indian.  I was about  yards away.
  0    HADEN  Which one pulled the trigger?
  7    CATES  They ran.  As fast as they could. Caught a train.
  0    HADEN  How did they get away?
  7    CATES  I lost them, that's what happened.
  0    HADEN  What the bell happened?
  7    CATES  I'll keep it in mind.
  0    HADEN  Try not to get your ass shot to pieces. We got enough dead cops on this one.
  7    CATES  Yeah?
  0    HADEN  Jack?
  7    CATES  You really know how to send a guy out with a great attitude. He starts to go.
  0    HADEN  Okay.  You're not a team player. You gotta do things your own way. Fine.  Nail this guy and make us all look good.  But you better watch your ass.  If you screw up, I can promise you, you're goin' down.
  7    CATES  Being a hot dog's worked pretty well for me so far... Besides, I got a lead...
  0    HADEN  You might be more of a team player and a little less of a hot dog on this one, Jack.
  7    CATES  Yeah.  It bothers me when cops get hurt while I'm makin' a play. I don't like it.
  0    HADEN  Anthing botherin' you besides losin' your gun?
  7    CATES  Yeah...
  0    HADEN  Jack, come on, there is an official department policy about cop killings. Cop killers represent a special priority because any man crazy enough to kill a cop is a greater threat to an unarmed civilian... In other words, we can't seen like we're in the revenge business... I know, we all know the truth's a little different.
  7    CATES  Hey, the bastard's got my gun.  I want it back.
  0    HADEN  Yeah, I read the report...
  7    CATES  I want to be left alone on this one. Algren was killed with my gun.
  7    YOUNG COP  I guess when two cops die on account of your fuck up you want to keep it as quiet as possible...
  7    CATES  Are you gonna tell me about police procedure?  Do me a favor, don't give me a bunch of crap.
  7    YOUNG COP  Somebody steals your gun, you're supposed to file a report.
9  7    CATES  The truth hurts, doesn't it, buddy?
8  7    YOUNG COP  But that's what you say about all of us all the tine ... we're always the ones fucking up when you tell it...
7  7    CATES  Yeah.
6  7    YOUNG COP  That's what you say, Cates...
  3    KEHOE  I'm not paid to take your personal calls.  He was in some bar. .. off duty.
  7    CATES  Jesus Christ.  Why the hell didn't you tell me before?
  7    CATES  What?
  3    KEHOE  I almost forgot.  That pal of yours from the Vice Squad wants you to call him.
  3    KEHOE  Okay.  See you in the morning... you know, you ought to get some rest...
  7    CATES  I got to wait for a call.
  3    KEHOE  I'm heading out. How about you?
  7    CATES  Bullshit red tape.
  3    KEHOE  Nothing.
  7    CATES  Nothing came in for me yet?  No calls?
  3    KEHOE  Doesn't look like it.
  7    CATES  Aw, bullshit, you heard wrong.
  3    KEHOE  Long night, too, from what I heard ... Word's going around that in addition to losing Ganz for the second time, and in addition to Haden busting you back to Patrolman, some jig beat the crap out of you.
  7    CATES  So do you...been a long day.
  3    KEHOE  You look awful.
  7    CATES  One of  em's in the slam.
  3    KEHOE  Here's the file. Cates checks the file.
  7    CATES  I think I wanna have a discussion about it with any of the ones still walking.  Can we find them?
  3    KEHOE  Hey ... Dick Tracy.
  7    CATES  Tell me that's not the same guy.
  3    KEHOE  Uhh ... Wong, Henry Wong.  He was in on the same job.
  7    CATES  Wait a minute, wait a minute... who's this?
  3    KEHOE  They all pulled a bunch of jobs with Ganz about four years ago.
  7    CATES  Who are all these?
  3    KEHOE  Backup man from the East Bay. Worked with Ganz a few years ago and sprung him from the road gang.
  7    CATES  Billy Bear...
  7    CATES  Shit.
  3    KEHOE  This guy must have had a . like yours, Jack. Now he's got yours.
  7    CATES  I'll help you out.
  3    KEHOE  Every last bit of it.  The big guy's room was empty.
  7    CATES  Is that what this guy Ganz had in the hotel?
3  5    LUTHER  I dunno ... he's gonna call me...
2  7    CATES  When? How?
1  5    LUTHER  He ... he wants me to help him skip town.
9  5    LUTHER  I don't know.
8  7    CATES  I think I met her.  Now tell us something we don't know, like where they stashed her.
7  5    LUTHER  Ganz and Billy got my girl, Rosalie.
3  5    LUTHER  Who gives a fuck what you think?
2  7    CATES  You just took a shot at me, asshole. I think you do know where he is.
1  5    LUTHER  Haven't seen him for years. That's the truth.
0  7    CATES  I sure ain't his fairy godmother... now I'm looking for Ganz...where is he?
L  5    LUTHER  A cop...
5  7    CATES  That's what I always say.
4  8    ELAINE  You're impossible...
3  7    CATES  He's takin' care of the same business I'll be takin' care of - soon as I dry off.
2  8    ELAINE  Tell me.
1  7    CATES  Promised I'd turn my back while he... ah, never mind...
0  8    ELAINE  Where is he?
  7    CATES  Three more hours...
  7    CATES  Yeah, bein' a hard-ass all the time is a real drag, but it works.
  8    ELAINE  I've been waiting a long time to hear you say that.
  7    CATES  Usual bullshit.  You make one smart move and everybody wants to be your friend... You know somethin', shootin' guys sucks. Especially compared to this.
  8    ELAINE  How'd they take it back at headquarters?
3  7    CATES  Let's go, Reggie.
2  8    ELAINE  What do I know?  I'm just a bartender.
1  7    CATES  Whaddya think?
8  8    ELAINE  Oh, yeah, well look where you came when you were down and out.
7  7    CATES  Hey, Come on, shrink time's over. They wouldn't go see some old girlfriend.
6  8    ELAINE  When a guy hurts you, then comes back bleeding on his hands and knees, who knows, he might just be irrestible.
5  7    CATES  So what?
4  8    ELAINE  It might pay to reexamine a few of your more primitive notions.  I was in bed with a girlfriend watching TV last week, Jack, and one thing we know about me is I happen not to be a lesbian ... Now, if this Indian's girlfriend got upset when you came looking for him, it could just be she's still vulnerable to him.
3  7    CATES  Come on, they were a little old for a slumber party.
2  8    ELAINE  What makes you think they were lesbians, or as you so quaintly put it, dykes?
  8    ELAINE  Jack, it's all over the papers. He's an obvious type.  But this Indian...
  7    CATES  How do you know?
  8    ELAINE  Ganz is going to be hard to track. Just a pure schizo ... wires all crossed... totally without any pattern... kill anybody... The Indian... himself... anybody...
  7    CATES  Nothing.  No sign of Ganz.  No sign of the Indian.  Airport's clean.  Train station. Bus station.  Docks... Shit...
6  7    CATES  I've been better...Dead end.  No Ganz, no Indian.
5  8    ELAINE  You real down?
3  7    CATES  We and my pal here have been taking it on the chin for the last few hours...
2  8    ELAINE  I can see that.  Pardon me for saying so, but you look like shit.  What happened?
1  7    CATES  Don't.  We've had a hard night.
0  8    ELAINE  I ought to have you and your friend thrown out...
9  7    CATES  Hiya, kid.
8  8    ELAINE  Hey, I don't believe it.
L  8    ELAINE  Fuck you.
L  7    CATES  Hi, it's me...
9  8    ELAINE  Hello.
  7    CATES  Just a second, that's all!
  8    ELAINE  Jack, wait...
  7    CATES  Elaine, I gotta put you on hold...
  8    ELAINE  Jack?  What was that?
  7    CATES  The number ... what's the Goddamn number?
  8    ELAINE  So am I.
  7    CATES  No, it's I'm just surprised you called.
  8    ELAINE  No wonder you're so popular.
  7    CATES  Elaine! I... I'm sorry... I was expecting somebody else... police business.
  8    ELAINE  I'm at work, asshole.  Where else?
L  8    ELAINE  This is not the way people who care for each other are supposed to behave.
9  7    CATES  Listen, Goddamn it if you think I'm happy about it, you're nuts. I just gotta take care of a few things, okay?
7  7    CATES  Elaine, look, I'm in the middle of sone stuff right now... I'm not gonna have time to come by. I don't know when I can get there.
6  8    ELAINE  Just one.  Some lady called.  Said she's a little hot-headed sometimes... But she still wants her occasional roommate. She'd like to talk it over after she gets off work tonight... if it's humanly possible....
L  8    ELAINE  I get that. The job first. Everything else, especially me, second. I get it. I don't like it.
  7    CATES  That's right.  I'm not like you. I'm not gonna sit on my ass wondering what's right and what's wrong... There's a psycho out there killing people with my gun and I'm gonna get him.  Because it's my job. And if you don't get that...
  8    ELAINE  Here it comes again ... the sacred job...
L  7    CATES  I didn't get burned, two cops did. Listen, I'll tell you about personnel responsibility.  I like to get the job done right.  And if I don't get my job done right... I'm for shit.
  8    ELAINE  Look, Jack, if you make everything your personal responsibility, you'll turn into a bad cop.  It's not a practical way to function...
  7    CATES  Bullshit?  I'll tell you about bullshit.  My gun's a real weapon in the hands of a real maniac who knows how to use it.  It isn't my macho bullshit that's killing people, my gun is ...
  8    ELAINE  Look, spare me the macho bullshit about your gun...
  7    CATES  Sure, okay, fine, no problem... See, there's this kid in jail ... First thing I got to do is go up and see what he knows ...
  8    ELAINE  Jack, are you okay?
  7    CATES  Yeah, Guess it must have been a slow news day...
  8    ELAINE  You made the front page.
  7    CATES  Yeah, one of my favorites.
  8    ELAINE  Great place for lunch.
L  7    CATES  Guess people ought to know who I am...
L  8    ELAINE  I think you forgot this. Hands him his wallet and badge...
L  7    CATES  Thanks for the coffee.
L  8    ELAINE  Yeah, for some reason, I'm sure...
L  7    CATES  You sure you want me to?
L  8    ELAINE  Call me later.
L  7    CATES  That's the way I see it, too.
L  8    ELAINE  You know something, Jack, you really are hopeless.
L  8    ELAINE  I wish you'd stop trying to make me mad so I won't care for you... I wish you'd give me a little more of a chance.
L  7    CATES  What do you want to know?  What difference does it make?  I'm the guy in your bed the last three months.  I make you feel good. You make me feel good.  What the hell else do you want from a guy?
L  8    ELAINE  When you start with that attitude... it's like I don't know who you are.
L  7    CATES  Maybe you don't know what the hell you're talking about.
L  8    ELAINE  Maybe that makes a nice excuse.
L  7    CATES  Maybe I got a fairly crummy day ahead.
L  8    ELAINE  That's a fairly crummy way to start a morning.
L  8    ELAINE  Maybe I would if I knew when you were coming back.
L  7    CATES  Maybe you ought to buy me one.
L  7    CATES  What makes you think I have any clean shirts at my place?
L  8    ELAINE  You know, if you let me come over to your place once in a while, you could put on a clean shirt in the morning.
8  7    CATES  I think you're ashamed to tend bar which is sad because you look great in that outfit they make you wear... You pull down four bills a week which is damn good, and you mix the best Pina Coladas I've ever had... I think that if you need bigger and better things ... then go for em.
7  8    ELAINE  Tell me--I'm dyin' to hear it.
6  7    CATES  Hey, you know what I really think?
5  8    ELAINE  If this is your idea of sympathetic interest in my problems, I'll take brutal indifference.
4  7    CATES  I do think all psychotherapy is bullshit. But just because I think it's bullshit doesn't mean I don't know something about it.
3  8    ELAINE  Aren't you the one that thinks all psychotherapy is bullshit?
2  7    CATES  Positive self-image problem all over again ... You are who you decide you are unless you're the type that lets assholes decide for you.
1  8    ELAINE  Then I sit back and I think, I mean, who's to say I'm not a dumb bitch.  I work in a bar, right? I can't read a list of my academic credentials to every booze-hound that comes in the place... You are what you do...
0  7    CATES  I guess he got the message...
9  8    ELAINE  Irrigated his face with the shot of J and B I'd just poured him. Then I tried to deck the sucker.
8  7    CATES  What'd you do?
7  8    ELAINE  A guy in the bar called me a dumb bitch today.
6  7    CATES  What's wrong with that?
5  8    ELAINE  I'm all wet.
4  7    CATES  That's the way I see it, too.
3  8    ELAINE  You're hopeless.
2  7    CATES  Hey, you're right.
1  8    ELAINE  I still don't think it's loaded.
0  7    CATES  This is a . Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world. You gotta ask yourself just one question. Are you feelin' lucky?
L  8    ELAINE  I don't think your gun's loaded...
L  7    CATES  I don't answer questions, I ask 'em...
L  8    ELAINE  What am I wanted for?
  8    ELAINE  In all due respect, he sounds kind of pathetic to me.  The kind of guy that runs home to his momma or some girlfriend.  Have you two ace detectives checked that out?
  1    HAMMOND  He was the only one of my bunch that was my friend... He was loyal, went all the way for you...
  8    ELAINE  That's no bull.
  1    HAMMOND  Hey, two days with him is enough.
  8    ELAINE  How would you know?
9  1    HAMMOND  Hard man to live with.
8  8    ELAINE  Shrink major, not a shrink.
7  1    HAMMOND  Well, I been workin' the other side of the street for the last few years.  And you don't exactly look like a shrink, wearin' that dress...
6  8    ELAINE  I'm not so sure I can say the same thing...You don't look like a cop.
